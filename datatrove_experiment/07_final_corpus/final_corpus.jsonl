It is closely related to adenosine and the adenosine nucleotides in structure. Multiple adverse events have been reported to the Agency, including acute kidney injury. Additionally, the Emergency Use Authorization describes a known risk of increased transaminase elevations during remdesivir treatment. However, as COVID-19 can also lead to serious outcomes, including acute kidney injury, the contribution of remdesivir to these adverse events is unclear. DARS performed multiple computational analyses, primarily based on structural similarity to other drugs, to evaluate remdesivir’s potential association with these adverse events. In silico pharmacologic target predictions performed using the software platform Clarity identified DNA polymerase as well as several adenosine and purine receptors as possible secondary targets of remdesivir and its metabolites. The sponsor-provided in vitro data found that most of these predictions were negative. Remdesivir did interact with DNA polymerase in vitro at clinically-relevant concentrations; however, development of toxicity through this mechanism generally requires chronic exposure and remdesivir is rapidly converted to its metabolites, which were not associated with DNA polymerase at clinically-relevant concentrations. Remdesivir was also evaluated using (quantitative) structure-activity [(Q)SAR] models for hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity. Remdesivir was predicted to be positive for hepatotoxicity; however, considering the rapid metabolism of remdesivir this may not be clinically significant. Additionally, remdesivir’s two metabolites, remdesivir triphosphate and GS-441524, were predicted to be positive for gall bladder disorders. All evaluated compounds were predicted to be negative or undeterminable for renal toxicity in the (Q)SAR models. Finally, a structural similarity search revealed several nucleoside analogs as potential comparators for remdesivir and GS-441524. Several of these closely related compounds are associated with some degree of kidney and/or liver issues and contain statements in their drug labels about the need for clinical monitoring of renal and liver function. In conclusion, in silico analyses identified that remdesivir or its metabolites are structurally similar to other drugs that have been associated with some degree of renal and/or liver issues and their labels recommend monitoring renal and/or liver toxicity. Remdesivir’s EUA does recommend daily monitoring of hepatic laboratory testing. These in silico analyses can be taken into account with other nonclinical and clinical data when evaluating the potential for remdesivir to be associated with renal or liver adverse events and the potential need for clinical monitoring. Reference ID: 4652285 2 Background Remdesivir is currently approved under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for COVID-19. It is a nucleotide analog of adenosine that inhibits viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, leading to early chain termination and inhibiting viral replication (Eastman et al 2020). It was previously under investigation as a treatment for several other viruses, including Ebola. Multiple adverse events have been reported to the Agency, including acute kidney injury. However, as COVID-19 can be associated with adverse outcomes, it is not clear if remdesivir is causing these adverse events and conclusive data on the safety of remdesivir in patients with kidney injury or disease are lacking (Adamsick et al 2020). Additionally, the Emergency Use Authorization describes a known risk of increased transaminase elevations in healthy volunteers and patients with COVID-19 who received remdesivir during clinical trials. The Division of Pharmacoepidemiology II requested an analysis of the structure and adverse event potential of remdesivir. Evaluation Target Prediction A target prediction evaluation was performed for remdesivir, two metabolites (remdesivir triphosphate and GS-441524), and the excipient sulfobutylether-beta-cyclodextrin to identify potential secondary targets that may result in renal adverse events (Table 1). Target prediction was performed with Clarity, a predictive analytics platform consisting of six integrated models that make predictions for secondary pharmacology activity based on drug structure and publicly-known primary target activity. As this tool has not been fully evaluated by the FDA, results should only be used for hypothesis generation. The excipient sulfobutylether-beta-cyclodextrin was too large to analyze with Clarity and was therefore excluded from this analysis. Table 1. Clarity predictions for remdesivir and metabolites. K: Known, Clarity has the interaction stored in the database from literature, patents, or other references. P: Predicted, Clarity made a prediction based on structural similarity or other properties of the molecule. Remdesivir Remdesivir Trisphophate GS-441524 DNA Polymerase P P P Adenosine receptor A1 P P Adenosine receptor A2 P P Adenosine receptor A3 P P Adenosine kinase P P2Y purinoceptor P Reference ID: 4652285 3 P2X purinoceptor P One prediction of note is DNA polymerase. Many nucleoside analogs, such as remdesivir, can also act human DNA polymerase. This can lead to mitochondrial toxicity, which includes myopathy, neuropathy, hepatic steatosis, lactic acidosis, and nephropathy (Khungar and Han 2010). Of note, a study entitled “In Vitro Evaluation of GS-5734 [remdesivir] Effects on Mitochondrial DNA Content” submitted with the remdesivir IND application (IND 125566) found that at Ebola therapeutic concentrations (1 µM in rhesus macaques), no significant reduction in mitochondrial DNA was observed. At twice the therapeutic concentration (2 µM in rhesus macaques), 26% reduction in mitochondrial DNA occurred. For COVID-19, the Cmax after the Day 1 200 mg dose is approximately 9 µM (EMA), which is significantly higher than the concentration evaluated in the macaque study. For COVID-19, remdesivir is given for an additional 5 to 10 days at 100 mg. While remdesivir reaches relevant concentrations related to this in vitro assay, remdesivir is rapidly metabolized to remdesivir triphosphate (Warren et al 2016) and kidney adverse events due to mitochondrial toxicity are generally seen after months rather than days of treatment (Herlitz et al 2010). Thus, while this is unlikely to be the mechanism of potential kidney adverse events, it may deserve further investigation. An additional study in the IND application, “Interaction of GS-443902, the Active Nucleoside Triphosphate Metabolite of GS-5734, with Host RNA and DNA Polymerase Enzymes”, found that at concentrations up to 200 µM, none of the DNA or RNA host (human) polymerases tested were inhibited. Remdesivir triphosphate only reaches a Cmax of 0.5 µM after the Day 1 dose (EMA). As kidney adverse effects due to mitochondrial toxicity are seen after months rather than days of treatment (Herlitz et al 2010) and the active metabolite does not reach concentrations significant to mitochondrial toxicity, it is unlikely that interaction with host polymerases contributes significantly to the toxicities observed. Also of note, while both remdesivir and GS-441524 were predicted to bind at multiple adenosine receptors (which could subsequently lead to additional effects on heart rate, respiration, and blood pressure), secondary pharmacology screening for GS-441524 and a diastereomic mixture of remdesivir (GS-466547) submitted with the IND application indicated that neither compound demonstrated significant binding at adenosine A1, adenosine A2A, or the adenosine transporter. Finally, while the P2R purinoceptors were predicted and are often associated with renal effects (Menzies et al 2017), confidence for these predictions was weak. Therefore, these predictions do not warrant further investigation at this time. All other predicted targets had little to no effect on the renal or hepatobiliary system. (Quantitative) Structural Activity Relationship Analysis The DARS Computational Toxicology Consultation Service (CTCS) evaluated the four structures, remdesivir (API), remdesivir triphosphate, GS-441524, and cyclodextrin excipient for potential renal and liver toxicity effects using (quantitative) structure-activity relationship [(Q)SAR] models. Additionally, a structure-based search was performed to identify other drugs with high similarity to the three drugs that could serve as comparators. The (Q)SAR models predicted remdesivir to be positive for hepatotoxicity; however, considering the rapid metabolism of remdesivir this may not be clinically significant (Warren et al 2016).

Structural Similarity Search As remdesivir is a nucleoside analog, adenosine and guanosine analogs that are str11cturally similar were identified and evaluated for their potential to induce hepatic and renal adverse events based on pre- and post-market clinical experience . The mugs evaluated are analogs for both remdes ivir and GS-441524 . Several of these closely related compounds, paiiicularly clofai·abine, didanosine , and ganciclovir, contained statements in their di11g labels on the need for clinical monitoring for renal and/or liver function. These results suppoit monitoring for these potential adverse effects, but they do not conclusively predict hepatotoxicity or renal toxicity for remdesivir, remdesivir tr·iphosphate, or GS-44 1524.

In contrast, the cyclodextrin excipient present in the formulation was predicted to be negative or undeterminable for all endpoints. Additionally, remdesivir, remdesivir triphosphate, GS-441524, and cyclodextrin excipient were predicted to be negative or undeterminable for renal toxicity disorders. A structural similarity search revealed several nucleoside analogs as potential comparators to remdesivir and GS-441524. Several of these closely related compounds, particularly clofarabine, didanosine, and ganciclovir, contained statements in their drug labels on the need for clinical monitoring for renal and/or liver function. In conclusion, in silico analyses identified that remdesivir and its metabolites are structurally similar to other drugs that have been associated with some degree of renal and/or liver issues and their labels recommend monitoring renal and/or liver toxicity. Remdesivir’s EUA does recommend daily monitoring of hepatic laboratory testing. These in silico analyses can be taken into account with other nonclinical and clinical data when evaluating the potential for remdesivir to be associated with renal or liver adverse events and the potential need for clinical monitoring.

DX is an expert rule-based platform, which uses a knowledgebase of structural alerts to support a prediction. In contrast, LMA and CU are statistical-based platforms containing models constructed through machine-learning. The LMA and CU models were constructed from training sets generated from post-market adverse event reports in FDA’s Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). The hepatotoxicity training sets were further supplemented with data from drug labels and the published literature. All (Q)SAR model outputs were reviewed with the use of expert knowledge in order to provide additional supportive evidence on the relevance of any positive, negative, conflicting or inconclusive prediction and provide a rationale to support the final conclusion.

Whi le remdesivir is predicted to be hepatotoxic due to the organophosphate moiety, this is mostly based on animal studies. There is limited evidence that this toxicity is significant clinically [Arao T, 2002]. Furthermore , remdesivir is rapidly metabolized to its active monophos phate form [Warren e t al. 2016] and therefore the organophospha te moiety is unlikely to be an issue. Remdesivir triphosph ate was predicted to be positive for gall bladder disorders and equivocal for cholestasis and bile duct disorders . GS441524 was predicted to be positive for gall bladder disorders and equivocal for bile duct disorders. The alerting fragments for hepatotoxicity found in remdesivir, remdesivir triphosphate, and GS441524 , are identical to groups found in the endogenous compounds adenosine monophosphate, adenosine triphosphate , and adenos ine, respectively . The nitrile group­ which is the main difference between remdesivir, remdesivir triphosphat e, and GS441524-was either flagged as unknown to the model or was not detected as an alerting fragment. While these observations may seem to be deficienc ies in the models, there are other compounds identified by these alerts, particularly fludara bine and clofarabine, which are structurally similar to GS441524 and which have evidence of hepatotoxicity in their drug labels; therefore, the alerts should be taken seriously. In all mode ls of nephrotoxicity , remdesivir, remdesivir triphosph ate, and GS441524 were either predicted as negative or no prediction was possible. It should be noted however that several closely related compounds, particularly clofarabine and ganciclovir, have clinically significant nephrotoxicity as documen ted in their drug labels. 20 Reference ID 4652285 21 Considering the unusual nature and high concentration of the cyclodextrin excipient present in the formulation, this compound was also evaluated for hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity. However, no evidence for toxicity at these endpoints was found. Overall, the results identified some possible associations between structural attributes of remdesivir, remdesivir triphosphate, or GS-441524 and liver/kidney toxicities, but they did not conclusively predict these effects.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the virus that causes COVID-19 disease. SARS-CoV-2 uses an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) for replication. Remdesivir (RDV) is an inhibitor of the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. Phase 3 clinical studies were conducted to evaluate RDV for the treatment of COVID-19 in hospitalized adult patients. Pharmacokinetics of RDV and metabolites (GS-704277 and GS-441524) was not assessed in these trials. The clinical pharmacology package included the following: Studies of safety, PK, and mass balance in healthy adults. In vitro assessment of ADME, enzyme and transporter substrate properties of RDV and metabolites, inhibitory effect of RDV and metabolites on enzymes and transporters and whether RDV and metabolites are inducers of drug metabolizing enzymes. Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic (PBPK) Modeling and Population Pharmacokinetics (PopPK) analysis with the objective of predicting plasma exposures of RDV and metabolites in pediatric patients (this review only focused on the predicted exposure in pediatric patients 12 years of age and older and weighing at least 40 kg). The clinical pharmacology review primarily focused on addressing the following two questions: 1) Based on the review of the in vitro enzyme and transporter studies, is there a need to conduct in vivo drug-drug interaction (DDI) trials? 2) Is the dosing regimen for pediatric patients 12 years of age and older and weighing at least 40 kg acceptable? 1.1 Recommendations Review Issue Recommendations and Comments Pivotal or supportive evidence of effectiveness Pivotal evidence of effectiveness comes from randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial ACTT-1, which enrolled hospitalized subjects with mild, moderate, or severe COVID-19. Subjects in the RDV arm received 200 mg IV on day 1 and 100 mg IV on subsequent days for a total treatment duration of 10 days. The median time to recovery within 28 days of randomization (primary endpoint) was 10 days in the RDV group vs 14 days in the placebo group (recovery rate ratio 1.31, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.53). Supportive evidence comes from two open-label trials. GS-US-540-5773 evaluated hospitalized subjects with severe COVID-19 and GS-US-540-5774 evaluated hospitalized subjects with moderate COVID-19. Subjects in the RDV arm of these trials received 200 mg IV on day 1 and 100 mg IV on subsequent days for a total treatment duration of five or 10 days. Reference ID: 4672801 5 General dosing instructions 200 mg IV on day 1 and 100 mg IV daily for up to a total of 10 days. The recommended infusion duration is 30-120 minutes. Dosing in patient subgroups (intrinsic and extrinsic factors) Drug interactions – effect of other drugs on RDV and metabolites In vitro studies were conducted to evaluate RDV and metabolites as a substrate of various drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters as outlined in the 2020 In Vitro Drug Interaction Studies- Cytochrome P450 Enzyme- and Transporter-Mediated Drug Interactions Guidance for Industry (referred to as the “drug interaction guidance” in the remainder of the review). RDV is approximately 80 % metabolized by carboxylesterases (CES) 1 and 2 with additional metabolism mediated by Cathepsin A (10 %) and CYP3A (10 %). RDV is a substrate of OATP1B1 and P-gp transporters. Metabolite GS-704277 is a substrate of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. The clinical relevance of these in vitro assessments has not been established. Drug-drug interaction trials of RDV and other concomitant medications have not been conducted, however, the applicant will conduct a DDI trial of RDV with rifampin (broad spectrum inducer of enzymes/transporters) as a Post Marketing Requirement (PMR). Drug Interactions – effect of RDV and metabolites on other drugs In vitro studies were conducted to evaluate RDV and metabolites as an inhibitor or inducer of drug metabolizing enzymes and as an inhibitor of transporters. Using drug interaction guidance recommended equations for predicting the potential for clinically significant DDIs, RDV at day 1 Cmax (after administration of 200 mg) is a potential inhibitor of CYP3A, UGT1A1, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, and MATE1. However, RDV at two hours after day 1 Cmax is a potential inhibitor of only MATE1 and at four hours after day 1 Cmax is not a potential inhibitor of any enzymes/transporters. GS-704277 and GS-441524 are not expected to affect enzymes or transporters recommended for evaluation in the drug interaction guidance. Overall, due to the short term (up to 10 days) duration of RDV therapy, short duration of predicted effect on substrate drugs (up to four hours of a 24-hour dosing interval on Day 1), and considering that the inhibitory effect on UGT1A1 or MATE-1 substrates is not generally clinically significant, we do not recommend additional human DDI trials to evaluate the effect of RDV on other drugs. Renal Impairment The most abundant metabolite of RDV, GS-441524, is primarily renally eliminated. Structurally related drugs to RDV such as sofosbuvir and tenofovir alafenamide also form metabolites that are renally eliminated and whose plasma exposures are significantly elevated in subjects with renal impairment. The PK of RDV and metabolites have not been evaluated in subjects with chronic renal impairment. Subjects with creatinine clearance (calculated by Cockcroft-Gault) ≥30 mL/min were enrolled in Phase 3 studies; however, screening was not conducted to determine if subjects with creatinine clearance <90 mL/min had acute or chronic renal impairment. Further, population PK analyses cannot support determination of the effect of renal impairment on RDV clearance as subjects included in the analysis (healthy subjects) had a minimum creatinine clearance value of 87 mL/min. There is an agreed upon PMR to conduct a renal impairment PK study in subjects with all categories of chronic renal impairment. Reference ID: 4672801 6 Hepatic impairment RDV is primarily metabolized and conversion to its metabolite(s) could potentially be reduced in subjects with hepatic impairment. The PK of RDV and metabolites have not been evaluated in subjects with hepatic impairment. Clinical scoring for hepatic impairment (such as Child-Pugh or MELD score) was not conducted in Phase 3 studies. There is an agreed upon PMR to conduct a hepatic impairment study in subjects with moderate and severe hepatic impairment. This PMR also includes a requirement to evaluate the PK of RDV and its metabolites in subjects with mild hepatic impairment depending on results in those with moderate and severe hepatic impairment. Pediatrics (≥12 years of age and weighing ≥40 kg) Subjects <18 years of age were not enrolled in Phase 3 studies. Approval of the adult dose for pediatric patients ≥12 years of age and weighing ≥40 kg is based upon model-predicted comparable plasma exposures of RDV, GS-704277 and GS-441524 -relative to observed plasma exposures in healthy adults (4.3 Physiologically-based Pharmacokinetics Review, 4.4 Pharmacometrics Review) and safety data in lower body weight adults (40-50 kg) enrolled in Phase 3 studies. There is an agreed upon PMR to conduct a pediatric study in patients aged birth to <18 years of age. The primary endpoint is the assessment of pharmacokinetics of RDV and metabolites in the various age groups. Other intrinsic demographic factors In a popPK analysis of 123 healthy adults with intensive PK, demographic and clinical characteristics other than body weight were not found to significantly affect exposure of RDV or metabolites. Pregnancy Pregnant women were not enrolled in Phase 3 studies. However, extensive use in pregnant women is anticipated. There are various physiological changes during pregnancy that can potentially affect the PK of RDV, GS-704277 and GS-441524. There is an agreed upon Post Marketing Commitment (PMC) to conduct a PK study in pregnant women to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of RDV, GS-704277 and GS-441524. Bridge between the to-be- marketed and clinical trial formulations Not applicable for an IV product. While only the lyophilized powder was evaluated in Phase 3 studies, there is no expectation that the other IV formulation (solution) would differ in bioavailability. Reference ID: 4672801 7 1.2 Post-Marketing Requirements and Commitments The PMR/PMCs listed below are those agreed upon at the time of finalizing this review. See the action letter for the final list of PMR/PMCs. PMC or PMR Key issue(s) to be addressed Rationale Key considerations for design features PMR Effect of rifampin on the PK of RDV and metabolites -study period to evaluate the PK of RDV and metabolites after a single rifampin dose PK (effect of OATP inhibition) -study period to evaluate the PK of RDV and metabolites after multiple rifampin dosing (effect of CES, OATP, and/or P-gp induction) PMR Renal impairment -evaluation of mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment -measure unbound fraction PMR Hepatic impairment -evaluation of moderate and severe hepatic impairment -measure unbound fraction PMR Pediatrics -enrollment of ages birth - <18 years of age -primary endpoint of PK PMC Pregnancy See Executive Summary Comparison of PK in pregnant women vs an external control. Due to RDV being short-term therapy, PK during the post-partum period cannot serve as the control. PMR QT study See QT/IRT review dated 8/21/2020 (NDA 214787) Reference ID: 4672801 8 2.

Reference ID: 4672801 9 2.2 Dosing and Therapeutic Individualization 2.2.1 General dosing The recommended RDV dosing regimen was determined to be effective vs placebo in hospitalized subjects with mild, moderate, and severe COVID-19 in Phase 3 trial ACTT-1 (see 3.3.2). 2.2.2 Therapeutic individualization For patients with renal or hepatic impairment and pregnant women, PK data are unavailable to inform the need for dose adjustment and PK will be evaluated in these populations as part of PMR (in subjects with renal and hepatic impairment) and PMC (in pregnant women). In a popPK analysis of 123 healthy adults with intensive PK, demographic and clinical characteristics other than body weight were not found to significantly affect exposure of RDV or metabolites. While there is an effect of body weight on RDV and metabolites exposure, the recommended dosing regimen applies to all patients ≥40 kg. 2.3 Outstanding Issues None. Reference ID: 4672801 10 2.4 Summary of Labeling Recommendations Changes to clinical pharmacology-related labeling statements are summarized below (Table 2). “Final labeling language” in Table 2 refers to labeling changes agreed upon with the Applicant as of the date this review is finalized. See approved labeling for the most current labeling. Table 2. Summary of changes to clinical pharmacology-related labeling. Section(s) Topic Applicant’s initial labeling Final labeling language Notes / Rationale for differences between initial labeling and final labeling language 7 12.3 Effect of other drugs on RDV and metabolites and the effect of RDV on other drugs Drug-drug interaction studies have not been performed with VEKLURY. Clinical drug-drug interaction studies have not been performed with VEKLURY. In vitro, remdesivir is a substrate for drug metabolizing enzyme CYP3A4, and is a substrate for Organic Anion Transporting Polypeptides 1B1 (OATP1B1) and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) transporters. In vitro, remdesivir is an inhibitor of CYP3A4, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, and MATE1. GS-704277 is a substrate for OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. The clinical relevance of these in vitro assessments has not been established. Remdesivir is not a substrate for CYP1A1, 1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, or OATP1B3. GS-704277 and GS- 441524 are not substrates for CYP1A1, 1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2D6, or 3A5. GS-441524 is also not a substrate for CYP2C19 or 3A4. GS-704277 and GS 441524 are not substrates for OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, OCT2, MATE1, or MATE2K. GS 441524 is also not a substrate for OATP1B1 or OATP1B3. Text was initially present in section 7. Due to clinical significance not been established, the text was moved to section 12.3. We requested addition of pathways metabolites are a substrate of as well as pathways where RDV or metabolites are not a substrate. Note there are other enzymes/transporters that were evaluated in in vitro studies (such as non-CYP enzymes and certain transporters not mentioned in the drug interaction guidance (such as MRP, BSEP, etc). The enzymes/transporters listed in labeling are those recommended for routine evaluation according to FDA guidance. 12.3 Intrinsic factors Pharmacokinetic differences based on sex, race, age, renal function and hepatic function on the exposures of remdesivir have not been evaluated. No change. Reference ID: 4672801 (b) (4) (b) (4) 11 Pediatrics (≥12 years of age and weighing ≥40 kg) Using modeling and simulation, the recommended dosing regimen is expected to result in comparable steady-state plasma exposures of remdesivir and metabolites in patients 12 years of age and older and weighing at least 40 kg as observed in healthy adults. [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]. Removed Described analyses as “modeling and simulation” because two approaches (PBPK and popPK) were used. 12.2 Effect on QT interval . Paragraph deleted. The Applicant’s RDV concentration- QT analysis of PK data from Phase 1 PK studies could not exclude the possibility of small increases in the QTc interval. There is an agreed upon PMR to conduct a thorough QT study using a dose. The QT study will be conducted (NDA 214787, QT/IRT review dated 8/21/2020). 12.2 Exposure- response Not discussed. Remdesivir and metabolites exposure-response relationships and the time course of pharmacodynamics response is unknown. Per regulations, lack of exposure- response information should be described in labeling. Reference ID: 4672801 (b) (4) (b) (4) (b) (4) (b) (4) (b) (4) 12 3. COMPREHENSIVE CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY REVIEW 3.1 Overview of the Product and Regulatory Background RDV was initially developed for treatment of Ebola and was subsequently evaluated for treatment of COVID-19. The pivotal trial supporting approval for treatment of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients is randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial ACTT-1, with supportive evidence from open-label trials GS-US-540-5773 and GS-US-540-5774. The clinical pharmacology package included the following: Studies of safety, PK, and mass balance in healthy adults. In vitro assessment of ADME, enzyme and transporter substrate properties of RDV and metabolites, inhibitory effect of RDV and metabolites on enzymes and transporters and whether RDV and metabolites are inducers of drug metabolizing enzymes. Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic (PBPK) Modeling and Population Pharmacokinetics (popPK analysis with the objective of predicting plasma exposures of RDV and metabolites in pediatric patients (this review only focused on the predicted data from pediatric patients 12 years of age and older and weighing at least 40 kg). 3.2 General Pharmacology and Pharmacokinetic Characteristics RDV is a prodrug which requires hydrolytic cleavage prior to phosphorylation to the active triphosphate derivative (GS-443902). After administration of RDV to humans, moieties circulating in plasma include RDV and major inactive metabolites GS-441524 and GS-704277 (Figure 1). Based on calculated logD values, RDV is thought to passively enter cells with greater efficiency than GS- 441524 and the double-anion GS-704277. Once inside the cell, RDV is primarily metabolized to GS- 704277 by carboxylesterases (CES). CES1 is expressed in numerous human tissues, with greatest expression in liver, gallbladder and lung. CES expression in blood is relatively low. Intracellular GS- 704277 is converted to GS-441524-monophosphate, which is phosphorylated to the active triphosphate GS-443902 or dephosphorylated to GS-441524 (Figure 2).

Reference ID: 4672801 14 PK of RDV and metabolites was not evaluated in Phase 3 studies of subjects hospitalized with COVID-19.

In human plasma, RDV and GS-704277 are detected for up to six hours and eight hours post-dose. 3.3 Clinical Pharmacology Review Questions 3.3.1 To what extent does the available clinical pharmacology information provide pivotal or supportive evidence of effectiveness? The recommended RDV dosing regimen was determined to be effective vs placebo in hospitalized subjects with mild, moderate, and severe COVID-19 in Phase 3 trial ACTT-1. The median time to recovery within 28 days of randomization (primary endpoint) was 10 days in the RDV group vs 14 days in the placebo group (recovery rate ratio 1.31, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.53). PK of RDV and metabolites was not evaluated in this trial, thus exposure-response relationships are unknown. 3.3.2 Is the proposed dosing regimen appropriate for the general patient population for which the indication is being sought? Yes. The indication includes adults (included in Phase 3 studies) as well as adolescents 12 - <18 years of age and weighing ≥40 kg (not included in Phase 3 studies). Efficacy and safety of RDV in hospitalized adults weighing ≥40 kg with COVID-19 was demonstrated vs placebo in Phase 3 trial ACTT-1. The dosing regimen evaluated in ACTT-1 study was the same as that evaluated in a prior clinical trial for treatment of Ebola (200 mg on day 1 and 100 mg on subsequent days). Due to LFT elevations observed in healthy adult study GS-US-399-5505 (RDV administered 200 mg on day 1 and 100 mg daily for four or nine days), it may not be possible to further increase the RDV IV dose beyond 200 mg on day 1 and 100 mg on subsequent days. Reference ID: 4672801 15 Adolescents Extrapolation of efficacy is the approach used to support approval in adolescents 12 - <18 years of age and weighing ≥40 kg. Physiologically-based PK modeling (PBPK) and population PK modeling were used to predict exposures in patients 12 - <18 years of age and weighing ≥40 kg. PBPK accounts for age- dependent physiological changes, drug-specific physicochemical properties, and utilized observed PK data in healthy adults to predict plasma exposures in patients 12 - <18 years of age and weighing ≥40 kg. Population PK modeling used observed PK data in healthy adults (median [range] body weight of 77 kg [53, 101]) and allometric scaling to predict exposures in patients ≥40 kg. The recommended RDV dosing regimen is predicted to result in comparable plasma exposures of RDV, GS-704277 and GS-441524 across the weight range of 40-80 kg (Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5) (4.3 Physiologically-based Pharmacokinetics Review, 4.4 Pharmacometrics Review). The body weight range of 40-80 kg includes body weights typical for patients 12 - <18 years of age as well as adults. According to the Clinical review team, acceptable safety was observed in the general adult population enrolled in ACTT-1 as well as adults with a relatively low body weight (40-50 kg, n=30).

Red = adult maximum: value observed in adults administered 150 mg IV daily. 3.3.3 Is an alternative dosing regimen and/or management strategy required for subpopulations based on intrinsic factors? Based on available data, there are no subpopulations requiring an alternative dosing regimen or management strategy. However, there are pending studies which will evaluate the impact of renal impairment, hepatic impairment, and pregnancy on the PK of RDV and metabolites (see 1.2 Post-Marketing Requirements and Commitments and 2.2.2 Therapeutic individualization). 3.3.4 Are there clinically relevant food-drug or drug-drug interactions and what is the appropriate management strategy? As RDV is administered IV, food-drug interactions are not applicable. Currently, there are no established or expected clinically significant PK-based DDIs associated with RDV. Coadministration of RDV with chloroquine phosphate or hydroxychloroquine sulfate is not recommended. As described in the Warning and Precautions and Microbiology sections of labeling, the in vitro antiviral activity of RDV was antagonized by chloroquine phosphate. In cell culture, higher remdesivir EC50 values were observed with increasing concentrations of chloroquine phosphate. Increasing concentrations of chloroquine phosphate reduced formation of remdesivir triphosphate in normal human bronchial epithelial cells See labeling or the Clinical Virology review for more details. Reference ID: 4672801 (b) (4) 19 Effect of other drugs on RDV and metabolites RDV and metabolites were evaluated in vitro as substrates of drug interaction guidance-recommended CYP enzymes and transporters. RDV is primarily metabolized by non-CYP enzymes and GS-441524 is not CYP metabolized. GS-704277 is a substrate of CYP3A4 and possibly CYP2C19. RDV is a substrate of OATP1B1 and P-gp transporters and GS-704277 is a substrate of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 transporters. The clinical relevance of these in vitro assessments has not been established. Due to its moderate to high extraction ratio of 0.6-0.8, it is unlikely that exposures of RDV or metabolites will be significantly affected by inhibitors of CES, CYP3A4, OATP, or P-gp. However, there is an agreed upon PMR for the Applicant to conduct a drug interaction trial of RDV coadministered with rifampin (broad spectrum inducer of enzymes/transporters). Effect of RDV and metabolites on other drugs In vitro studies recommended in the drug interaction guidance were conducted to evaluate RDV and metabolites as inhibitor of CYP enzymes and transporters, and for RDV as an inducer of CYP enzymes. P- gp inhibition by metabolites was not evaluated due to metabolites being more polar than parent drug (a rationale stated in FDA guidance). Nevertheless, the Applicant plans to conduct a study of P-gp inhibition by metabolites. Where in vitro data suggested the need for follow up evaluations, drug interaction guidance- recommended equations were used to evaluate the potential for a clinically significant DDI. Using RDV day 1 (200 mg) or maintenance dose (100 mg) Cmax, RDV is predicted to be an inhibitor of CYP3A, UGT1A1, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, and MATE1 (Table 4). However, by two hours after day 1 Cmax, inhibition of only MATE1 is predicted and by four hours after day 1 Cmax, no inhibition of any enzymes/transporters is predicted.

APPENDICES 4.1 Individual Study Reviews Human PK studies in healthy volunteers Single and Multip le Ascending Dose Study GS-US-399-1812 is a single ascending dose study to evaluate the safety and PK of IV remdes ivir in healthy adu lts. Ninety-s ix subjects were enro lled (78 received remdes ivir and 18 received placebo). Subjects were predom inantly of w hite race (89%) and male (58%). Cohorts 1-6 included dosing groups of 3, 10, 30, 75, 150 and 225 mg (N=8 active, N=2 placebo per group) where the solut ion formu lation was infused over t wo hours . Cohorts 7-9 (N=l O active, N=2 placebo per 20 Reference ID 4672801 21 group) evaluated the lyophilized formulation at different doses and infusion durations (Cohort 7: 75 mg over two hours; Cohort 8: 150 mg over two hours; Cohort 9: 75 mg over 30 minutes). Samples were collected from various matrices for measurement of remdesivir and metabolites: Plasma: intensive collection through 144 hours post-dose PBMCs: 12-24 hour intervals through 144 hours post-dose Urine: 6-12 hour intervals through 48 hours post-dose Semen: collected in male subjects pre-dose or three hours post-dose Plasma PK in cohorts 1-6: Remdesivir C max and AUC increased in proportion to dose with a Tmax of 2 h and a half-life 0.66-1.1 hours GS-441524 C max and AUC appeared to increase proportionally (cohorts 4 to 5) or more than proportionally (cohorts 1 to 3, 5 to 6) with dose, with a Tmax of 3.5-5.0 h and a half-life of 13-31 hours GS-704277 C max and AUC appeared to increase proportionally with dose, with a Tmax of 2.0-2.3 h and a half-life of 1-2 hours PK in PBMCs: GS-441524 C max and AUC appeared to increase less than proportionally (cohorts 4 to 5), proportionally (cohorts 1 to 3), or more than proportionally (cohorts 3 to 4) with dose, with a half- life of 32-48 hours GS-441524 C max and AUC increased approximately proportionally with dose in cohorts 7 to 8 with a half-life of 36-43 hours PK in urine: Remdesivir: Across the 3-225 mg dose groups, the percentage of dose recovered was 7-10% GS-441524: Across cohorts 2-9, the percentage of dose recovered was 34-41% GS-704277: Not measured PK in semen: Remdesivir was detected in all males in cohorts 7-9 at three hours post-dose and was not detectable in any pre-dose samples GS-441524 was detected at all timepoints in males except for one subject in each of cohort 7 and 9 GS-704277 was detected at all timepoints in males through day three Comparison of solution and lyophilized formulations (cohorts 4 vs 7 and 5 vs 8): RDV and GS-441524: similar exposures were observed in plasma after doses of 75 mg or 150 mg GS-704277: A statistical comparison was not conducted. Exposures of both formulations appear similar at a dose of 75 mg; exposures appear higher for the lyophilized formulation at a dose of 150 mg Reference ID: 4672801 22 Study GS-US-399-5505 is a multiple-dose safety and PK study of IV remdesivir (lyophilized formulation) in healthy adults. Plasma PK parameters from this study are included in labeling. Thirty-six subjects were enrolled; 29 received remdesivir and six received placebo. Subjects were predominantly of white race (61%) and male (81%). Subjects received 200 mg IV on day 1 and 100 mg daily on days 2-5 (cohort 1) or days 2-10 (cohort 2). Infusion durations were 30 minutes. Intensive plasma PK samples were collected through 24 hours (day 1) or 96 hours (day 5) postdose. PBMCs were collected every 6-12 hours through 24 hours (day 1) or 96 hours (day 5) postdose. Remdesivir was detectable in plasma for up to six hours postdose. The AUC accumulation ratio was 0.9. Half-lives of remdesivir and metabolites were consistent with study GS-US-399-1812 (Table 5, Table 6, Table 7, Table 8). Table 5. Remdesivir plasma PK parameters. Source: Study report.

GS-443902 plasma PK parameters. Source: Study report. Mass balance Study GS-US-399-4231 evaluated the mass balance of remdesivir. Subjects received a 150 mg single IV dose of remdesivir (solution formulation; mixture of unlabeled and radiolabeled) over 30 minutes. Eight subjects were enrolled (all male, 50% white race, 50% black race). Matrices collected through 168 hours postdose included blood (intensive sampling for whole blood and plasma concentrations), urine (intervals of six, 12, or 24 hours) and feces (24 hour intervals). Reviewer’s comments: Despite stated sampling through 168 hours postdose, results were reported for 192 h and 216 h timepoints. The blood-to-plasma ratio of total radioactivity ranged from 0.68 at 15 minutes from the start of infusion to 1.0 (five hour timepoint). Compared to study GS-US-399-1812, plasma RDV and GS-441524 AUCinf values were ~20% lower while GS-704277 AUCinf values were similar. Cumulative recovery of radioactivity from urine and feces was 92% (Table 9). Reference ID: 4672801 25 Table 9. Remdesivir and metabolites recovery in urine and feces.

Metabolites were profiled from samples pooled across subjects . The major moieties in plasma were GS- 441524 (44% of radioactivity), RDV (14%), and unknown metabolite M27 (11%). The major moieties in urine were GS-441524 (49%) and RDV (10%); six minor unidentified species accounted for 6% of the dose. The major moiety in feces was M14 (12%) with other peaks being <1% each. In vitro distribution Study AD-540-2007 evaluated distribution of remdesivir (0.5 µM) and GS-441524 between human cellular and soluble fractions of blood. The mean human blood/plasma concentration ratio was 0.76 for remdesivir and 1.19 for GS-441524. In study AD-540-2016, the mean human blood/plasma ratio of GS- 704277 (0.5 µM) was 0.56. Protein binding of remdesivir (study AD-399-2013) and its metabolites (study AD-399-2031) were evaluated using equilibrium dialysis at analyte concentrations of 2 µM. The free fraction of remdesivir, GS-704277 and GS-441524 were 12%, 99%, and 98%. In a second study (AD-540-2020), RDV protein binding was evaluated using equilibrium dialysis at RDV concentrations of 1-10 µM. Mean RDV fraction unbound was 6.5% at 1 µM and 7.4% at 10 µM. Reviewer’s comments: Remdesivir concentrations in the protein binding study exceeded human Cmax after a dose of 200 mg IV in AD-540-2020 but not in AD-399-2013. Metabolite concentrations in the protein binding study exceeded human Cmax after a dose of 200 mg IV in study AD-399-2031 (Table 10). Table 10.

Analyte molecular weights obtained from the PK Written Summary. In study AD-540-2008, mean free fractions of RDV (2 µM), GS-441524 (2 µM), and GS-704277 (3 µM) in the presence of human hepatic microsomal fraction were 58%, 89%, and 90%, respectively. Reference ID: 4672801 26 In vitro metabolism of RDV and metabolites Study AD-540-2022 evaluated metabolic stability of RDV when incubated with human hepatocyte and tissue fractions.. Estimated RDV hepatic fraction metabolized (fm) values were 0.8 for carboxylesterases, 0.1 for CYP3A, and 0.1 for cathepsin A. RDV can also be metabolized by human plasma and extra hepatic (intestinal) fraction. Study AD-540-2021 evaluated hydrolysis of RDV (incubated with cathepsin A, CES1b, CES1c, and CES2) and GS-704277 (incubated with HINT1). RDV was metabolized by cathepsin A, CES1b, and CES1c. GS- 704277 was metabolized by HINT1. Study AD-399-2011 evaluated CYP (CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) metabolism of RDV . Detectable metabolism was observed for CYP2C8, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. When normalized to hepatic expression levels, CYP3A4 is expected to have a greater contribution to RDV metabolism compared to CYP2C8 or CYP2D6. Study AD-540-2018 evaluated CYP (CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4 and CYP3A5) metabolism of RDV, GS-441524, and GS-704277. As found in AD-399-2011, remdesivir was metabolized by CYP2C8, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. No metabolism of GS-441524 was observed. Potential metabolism of GS-704277 by CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 was observed; however, the results were inconclusive due to poor analytical sensitivity. Study AD-540-2019 evaluated UGT (UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A4, UGT1A6, UGT1A9, UGT2B7 and UGT2B15) metabolism of RDV, GS-441524, and GS-704277. No metabolism was observed for RDV. Detectable UGT1A3 metabolism was observed for GS-441524 and GS-704277; however, a direct glucuronide metabolite was not detected for either metabolite.

In vitro induction of CYP enzymes by RDV and metabolites In study AD-399-2027, induction of CYP (CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP3A4) enzymes by RDV (10-50 µM), GS- 441524 (25-100 µM), and GS-704277 (10-50 µM) in human hepatocytes was evaluated. For RDV, induction of mRNA (no induction of enzyme activity) was observed in one of three donors for CYP1A2 (24% of positive control) and CYP2B6 (27% of positive control). RDV did not induce CYP3A4. No induction of mRNA or enzyme activity was observed for GS-441524 or GS-704277. In vitro inhibition of transporters by RDV and metabolites Inhibition of several transporters by RDV, GS-441524 and/or GS-704277 was observed (Table 14, Table 15, Table 16).

Reference ID: 4672801 31 Predicted clinical significance of in vitro interactions using mechanistic static equations Study AD-540-2024 used in vitro parameters and equations described in FDA guidance to calculate the potential for significant in vivo inhibition of enzymes or transporters by RDV, GS-441524, and GS- 704277. Using a basic model for reversible inhibition of enzymes (CYPs 1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 3A, UGT1A1, UGT2B7), R1≥1.02 indicates a potential interaction. R1≥1.02 was observed for several enzymes for RDV, GS-441524, and GS-704277. Further analysis of reversible inhibition was conducted using a mechanistic static equation where AUCR ≥1.25 indicates a potential interaction. Using RDV day 1 Cmax, AUCR≥1.25 was observed for RDV regarding inhibition of CYP3A and UGT1A1. However, using RDV day 1 concentration two hours after Cmax, no effect on CYP3A or UGT1A1 is predicted. AUCR≥1.25 was not observed for any enzyme for GS-441524 or GS-704277. RDV both inhibited and induced (one of three donors) CYP1A2 and CYP2B6. Using a combined mechanistic static equation, no interaction was predicted (AUCR of 0.91 for CYP1A2 and AUCR of 0.94 for CYP2B6). A basic model was used to determine potential inhibition of transporters by RDV, GS-441524, and GS- 704277. For OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, cutoff values were exceeded for RDV using day 1 Cmax but not two hours after day 1 Cmax. Cutoff values were exceeded for inhibition of MATE1 by RDV using day 1 Cmax but not when using the RDV concentration observed four hours after day 1 Cmax. Cutoff values were not exceeded for inhibition of OCT1 by RDV, GS-441524 and GS-704277, and were not exceeded for inhibition of OATP1B1/3 by GS-441524 and GS-704277. Cutoff values were not exceeded for inhibition of OAT1, OAT3, OCT2, or MATE2-K by RDV, GS-441524, or GS-704277.

Reference ID: 4672801 34 4.3 Physiologically-based Pharmacokinetics Review Executive Summary The objective of this review is to evaluate the adequacy of the Applicant’s physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) analysis to predict the plasma PK profiles of remdesivir (RDV) and metabolites (GS-704277 and GS-441524) in pediatric patients 12 years of age and older and weighing at least 40 kg. The Division of Pharmacometrics has reviewed the final PBPK report, supporting modeling files, and responses to our information requests (submitted on July 24, 2020) to conclude the following: The PBPK modeling for RDV was adequate to predict the plasma PK profiles of RDV, GS-704277 and GS-441524 in adults following the proposed dosing regimen (loading dose of 200 mg IV and 100 mg IV daily maintenance dose). The changes in the age-depended physiological parameters are not expected to significantly impact the plasma PK profiles of RDV, GS-704277 and GS-441524 for pediatric patients 12 years of age and older and weighing at least 40 kg. PBPK analysis can be used to provide supporting evidence for comparable plasma exposure of RDV and metabolites between adults and adolescents (12 years of age and older and weighing at least 40 kg) following the proposed dosing regimen. Background The proposed dosing regimen of remdesivir (RDV) is a single loading dose of 200 mg IV on Day 1 followed by once-daily maintenance doses of 100 mg IV from Days 2 for adults and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older and weighing at least 40 kg. Following a single IV administration of RDV 150 mg, RDV was rapidly eliminated followed by the sequential appearance of GS-704277 and GS-441524 in plasma. The intracellular metabolism of RDV is assumed to be mediated by phosphoramidase cleavage of GS-704277 to GS-441524-MP. GS-441524-MP then converts to the active triphosphate metabolite, GS-443902, via nucleotide kinases. Dephosphorylation of GS-441524-MP results in the nucleoside analog GS-441524 (Figure 6). Both GS- 441524-MP and GS-443902 are not detectable in the plasma. The Applicant stated that albumin is likely the main plasma binding protein for RDV, GS-704277 and GS-441524 [PBPK report QP-2020-1041]. The human mass balance study [Study GS-US-399-4231] reported that recovery of RDV was primarily from urine containing approximately 92% of the total dose. The predominant species detected in urine were GS-441524 (49%), followed by RDV (10%) and GS-704277 (2.9%). RDV exhibited a linear PK profile for doses ranging from 3 mg to 225 mg IV]. A PBPK modeling approach for RDV was proposed by the Applicant to support the selection of the proposed dosing regimen for pediatric patients (infants to adolescents) in the Initial Pediatric Study Plan (dated 4/30/2020 under IND 147753). FDA agreed that PBPK modeling approach could be used to support pediatric dose selection in the clinical PK studies; but cited several model limitations and indicated that the model needed to be further optimized for the intended application [FDA DARRTs ID 4593544]. PK data in patients < 18 years of age are not available at the time of NDA submission. Reference ID: 4672801 35 In the current NDA submission, the Applicant proposed the following language in their draft US label regarding PBPK analysis: Section 8.4 Section 12.3 This review evaluates the adequacy of the Applicant’s PBPK model to simulate the plasma PK profiles of RDV and metabolites GS-704277 and GS-441524 in adolescent patients (12 years of age and older and weighing at least 40 kg). Methods PBPK model structure The PBPK analysis was performed using the population-based PBPK software Simcyp® (V18, Simcyp Ltd., a Certara Company, Sheffield, United Kingdom). The software’s default “Healthy Volunteer” was used for simulating adult exposure of RDV and plasma metabolites. For the adolescent population, the Applicant created a modified “Pediatric” virtual population by sampling from the default pediatric population to compile a pediatric virtual population that is evenly distributed by body weight with an approximately equal proportion of males and females. The PBPK model of RDV was developed based on in silico derived physicochemical properties, in vitro, and clinical PK data [Studies GS-US-399-5505 and GS-US-399-1812]. Key model parameters are described as follows. In vitro, the unbound fraction of RDV in plasma (fup) ranged from 0.065-0.074 [AD-540-2020] to 0.12 [Study AD-399-2013]. The Applicant set fup as 0.12 and the blood-to-plasma ratio (B/P) as 0.76) [study AD-540-2007] in the PBPK model. A full PBPK distribution model was used for RDV and a Kp scalar of 0.56 was used to characterize RDV volume of distribution after IV administration (Vd= 45-102 L). Although in vitro RDV was a substrate for OATP1B and P-gp transporters, the model assumed that active transport does not mediate the disposition of RDV (perfusion rate-limited). This assumption seemed reasonable because RDV exhibits moderate-to-high hepatic extraction ratio. RDV is rapidly metabolized to GS-704277 by ester hydrolysis. Carboxylesterase 1 (CES1) was identified as the primary esterase responsible for hydrolysis of RDV in vitro [Report AD-540-2021]. In vitro, RDV was also identified as a minor substrate for CYP3A4 and cathepsin A (<10% each). Remdesivir also undergo renal elimination (8.7% of RDV was eliminated unchanged in urine). The observed renal clearance (CLr) of 5.71 L/h was included in the model. Reference ID: 4672801 (b) (4) 36 Reviewer’s comments: A two-fold difference in the RDV’s fup was reported between two in-vitro studies (see discussion in Section 4.1). Given the intrinsic clearance of RDV is estimated using retrograde method based on clinical PK data, the selection of RDV fup of 0.12 as PBPK model parameters is not expected to significantly impact the simulated plasma PK profiles of RDV and its metabolites. The PBPK model of RDV metabolite GS-704277 was developed based on physicochemical properties (in silico estimates), in vitro and clinical PK data [studies GS-US-399-5505 and GS-US-399-1812]. In vitro, the fup of GS-704277 was 0.99. Based on its physiochemical property, GS-704277 is expected to have a low cellular permeability and a minimal B/P value of 0.55 was assumed due to the high hydrophilicity (logP value of -2.31) and ionization at physiologic pH. A minimal PBPK distribution model, with a Kp scalar of 3.3 and single-additional compartment, was used to recover the observed PK profile in plasma. Because the intracellular metabolites of RDV (GS-441524-MP and GS-443902; see below) are not observed in plasma, these metabolites are not incorporated into the current PBPK model. Instead, the model assumed a single non-specific esterase process metabolizes GS-704277 directly to GS-441524 in the liver (See Figure 6). The PBPK model of RDV metabolite GS-441524 was developed based on physicochemical properties (in silico estimates), in vitro and clinical PK data [studies GS-US-399-5505 and GS-US-399-1812]. In vitro, the fup was 0.98 [study AD-399-2031] and B/P was 1.19 [study AD-399-2007]. A minimal PBPK distribution model, with a volume of distribution of 6.2 L/Kg and single-additional compartment, was used to recover the observed plasma PK profile. GS-441524 undergo renal elimination (35.4 % of RDV dose renally eliminated as GS-441524). The observed CLr value of 9.85 L/h was used in the model. Additional human hepatocyte clearance of GS-441524 was estimated to recover the AUC of GS-441524. The intracellular metabolism of RDV is assumed to be mediated by phosphoramidase cleavage of the phosphoramidate bond of GS-704277, liberating the nucleoside analog monophosphate, GS-441524-MP. Nucleotide kinases catalyze the intracellular conversion between GS-441524-MP and the active triphosphate metabolite, GS-443902. Dephosphorylation of GS-441524-MP results in the formation of the nucleoside analog GS-441524. The latter metabolite is observable in the plasma (Figure 6). Reference ID: 4672801 37 Figure 6.

Source: Made by the Reviewer based on Figure 1 of the PBPK report QP-2020-1041 Reviewer’s comments on the simplified model structure: The RDV metabolites GS-441524-MP and GS-443902 are produced intracellularly and undetectable in plasma. Since the current model did not include the intracellular metabolism of RDV to the active metabolite GS-443902, it limited the use of this PBPK model to provide pharmacodynamic analysis of RDV. The Reviewer acknowledges that the plasma PK profiles of RDV, GS-704277 and GS-441524 may not be relevant to the PK of the active metabolite in tissues. PBPK model performance The predictive performance of the PBPK modeling for RDV and the plasma metabolites GS-704277 and GS-441524 was evaluated by simulation of phase 1 exposure data in healthy adults, following administration of RDV 200 mg IV loading dose (0.5 h infusion) on Day 1, then 100 mg IV daily maintenance doses (0.5 h infusion) starting on Day 2, and continuing through Days 5 or 10 [Study GS-US- 399-5505]. PBPK model application The adult PBPK modeling for RDV was subsequently used to simulate steady-state pediatric exposures accounting for age-dependent changes in organ volume/size (liver and kidney), enzyme expression, plasma protein binding, and organ blood flow. Reference ID: 4672801 38 Reviewer’s comments on the clinical applicability of this model: Given the simplified model structure, the current PBPK modeling for RDV mainly accounted for changes in physiological parameters such as tissue/organ size/volume, blood flow rates, liver and kidney function, and to an extent, CES enzyme expression. Based on the default ontogeny function in the pediatric model (Simcyp V18), CES activity in adolescence (12-18 years of age) is mature by 12 years of age. Based on literature data1, CES1 and CES2 abundances in adolescence are about 80% and 95% of the adult values in the liver, respectively. While our current understanding of the ontogeny of this enzyme is mainly based on in-vitro information, given our current understanding of enzyme maturation rates in general, CES is likely mature in children over 12 years of age. Therefore, the uncertainty of Applicant’s ontogeny function for CES and its impact on the simulated plasma PK profiles can be considered low for adolescents (proposed pediatric population). On the other hand, the uncertainty of other assumptions on the metabolic pathways for ‘downstream’ metabolites vary. For example, there is high uncertainty of assuming that GS-441524 formation can be simplified by describing it using a single pathway (GS-441524 is directly formed from GS-704277). Reason is this assumption does not consider intracellular metabolic pathways where multiple enzymes and conversions are involved. However, the impact of such assumptions on simulated PK profiles could be lower if the key enzymes involved in the intracellular metabolic pathways are mature in adolescents. Overall, we consider the applicability of the proposed modeling approach to scale from adults to children (birth to < 18 years of age) to be limited when only incorporating changes in physiological parameters and some enzyme ontogeny. However, given the current knowledge about enzyme maturation in adolescents, we consider the current PBPK modeling reasonable to provide support for simulations of plasma PK profiles of RDV and metabolites GS-704277 and GS-441524 in pediatric patients over 12 years of age and weighing over 40 kg. The Reviewer noted a clinical study in pediatric patients across all age and body weight groups is planned/ongoing. The Reviewer acknowledged the current PBPK modeling for RDV does not account for the possibility of diminished liver or kidney function in patients due to SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or COVID-19 progression because the impact of infection/disease progression on the PK of RDV and metabolites is currently unknown. The Reviewer noted the current modeling for RDV is considered adequate for the Applicant’s intended purpose - scale plasma PK from adults to adolescents. However, given the current model structure and data limitations, the PBPK modeling for RDV should be further optimized to support future applications, such as evaluation of drug-drug interaction potential, PK/PD analysis and other pediatric age groups. 1 Boberg et al.

PBPK simulations reasonably described the observed PK profiles of remdesivir and metabolites GS- 704277 and GS-441524 in plasma following a loading dose of 200 mg IV on Day 1, then 100 mg IV daily doses on Days 2 - 5 to adult healthy volunteers, as shown in Figure 7. The Reviewer noted that simulated PK parameters of remdesivir and metabolites GS-704277 and GS- 441524 in plasma have reached steady-stated at Day 5 (result not shown). Thus, there is no difference between the plasma PK profiles simulated following 5-day or 10-day dosing regimens. Figure 7.

Source: Figure 2 of PBPK report QP-2020-1041 Reference ID: 4672801 40 Q2: Are the plasma PK profiles for remdesivir, GS-704277 and GS-441524 comparable between adults and adolescents following the proposed dosing regimen? Yes. As shown in Table 19, the PK parameters of RDV, GS-704277 and GS-441524 in plasma were comparable between those simulated in adolescents (≥ 12 years of age with body weight ≥ 40 kg) and those observed in adults after the proposed dosing regimen (200 mg IV loading dose on Day 1 followed by 100 mg IV daily maintenance doses) [GS-US-399-5505]. The predictions for RDV and GS-441524 in adolescents were less than 1.20-fold higher than the observed values in adults, for Cmax and AUC at Day 1 or steady-state (Day 5). While, the predictions for the PK of GS-704277 in adolescents were approximately 1.15 to 1.80- fold higher than the observed values in adults (Table 19). Reference ID: 4672801 41 Table 19.

Reference ID: 4672801 42 Under the proposed dosing regimen, the PBPK modeling for RDV was used to predict adolescent steady- state AUC (=AUCtau) values for RDV, GS-441524 and GS-704227. For RDV and metabolites, the target AUCtau range was based on a representative range of observed exposures in healthy adults after administration of the therapeutic dosing regimen: 200 mg IV loading dose and 100 mg IV daily maintenance doses [Study GS-US-399-5505]. As shown in Figure 8, the predicted steady-state AUCs for RDV and metabolites in adolescents (red line) were generally comparable to the median adult exposure (black line) and within the maximum and minimum range (green dashed lines), following the therapeutic dosing regimen. The PBPK model predictions showed that exposures to RDV and metabolites tended to be higher for adolescents in the lower body weight range (Figure 8). Nonetheless, most predicted exposures were within the variability (maximum and minimum range) observed in adults following the therapeutic dosing regimen, and below the pre-defined upper limit of exposure (see below). The Applicant considered it important to keep RDV and metabolites exposure at or below that previously observed after administration to healthy adults of a higher maintenance dose regimen: 150 mg IV daily for 14 days [Study GS-US-399-1954]. The maximum observed adult steady-state exposures to RDV, GS-704277 and GS-441524 were set as the upper limit of exposure for pediatric dose selection (orange line). Based on the target exposure ranges for RDV, GS-704277 and GS-441524, the Applicant’s proposed dose regimen of RDV for pediatric subjects 12 years of age and older and weighing at least 40 kg is reasonable.

Weight-for-age distribution for adolescents aged 12-18 years. Source: Made by the Reviewer based on CDC growth chart available at https://www.cdc.gov/growthcharts/clinical charts.htm Conclusions The Reviewer acknowledges the current PBPK modeling for RDV has limitations regarding model structure and metabolic pathways involved in RDV and metabolites disposition. However, the model included reasonable assumptions and provided a reasonable description of RDV and plasma metabolites disposition. Thus, the PBPK modeling for RDV was considered adequate to predict the plasma PK profiles of RDV, GS-704277 and GS-441524 in adults following a 200 mg IV loading dose on Day 1 followed by 100 mg IV daily maintenance doses PBPK analysis showed that the changes in the age-dependent physiological parameters are not expected to significantly impact the plasma PK profiles of RDV, GS-704277 and GS441524 for pediatric patients 12 years of age and older and weighing at least 40 kg. The applicability of the proposed PBPK modeling approach for the intended purpose -scale from adults to adolescents- was considered reasonable. Thus, the modeling is adequate to provide support for simulations of plasma PK profiles of RDV and metabolites GS-704277 and GS-441524 in pediatric patients 12 years of age and older and weighing at least 40 kg. Based on the target exposure ranges for RDV, GS-704277 and GS-441524 observed in healthy adults [Study GS-US-399-5505], the Applicant’s proposed dosing regimen of RDV in this pediatric population is reasonable. Reference ID: 4672801 45 4.4 Pharmacometrics Review Summary of Pharmcometric Finding The applicant is seeking a label for Remdesivir (RDV) with approved dosing down to 12 years of age. However, no clinical efficacy and PK data have been collected in adolescents. The approval pathway in pediatrics is extrapolation of efficacy to adults based on exposure matching between adolescents and adults. The applicant performed a Population PK (PPK) analysis to characterize the PK of RDV and its two metabolites in healthy volunteers and performed simulations with this model to determine the expected exposure range of these moieties in adolescents after receiving the same dosing regimen as in adults (200 mg on Day 1 and 100 mg QD thereafter). The reviewer has confirmed the applicant’s results and found their model to be a reasonable start for projecting PK into adolescents. A phase 2/3 study is planned, by the applicant, and agreed upon by the agency for children <18 years of age to establish PK and supportive efficacy information. Some pediatric safety data are available from a compassionate use program in patients with Ebola. Data were available for 25 subjects between 5 and 18 years of age and 16 subjects less than 5 years of age. Results of Sponsors Population PK Analysis The applicant’s PPK Model was developed using healthy adult data from studies GS-US-399-1812, GS- US-399-1954, and GS-US-399-5505. On average 24 samples per subject were included in the analysis from 123 subjects with a total of 2967 samples per analyte included. Summary statistics of baseline demographics for each study are shown in Table 21 and Table 21. Observed concentrations of RDV and its two metabolites from each study are depicted in Figure 10.

RDV, GS-704277, and GS-441524 Concentration-Time After Dose Profiles for Healthy Volunteers. (Source: Applicant’s Population PK Report, Figure 2) Reference ID: 4672801 47 Reviewer’s Comments: The applicant’s demographics are reasonable for capturing allometric relationships in adults (53 – 101 kg weight range). There is some overlap with the pediatric patient population weight range. Projections down to 12-years old will rely on the consistent use and experience of allometric relationships across pediatric PK in general. With regards to renal function, Table 20 indicates CRCL generally above 87 mL/min in the pop PK population. Thus, there is not adequate information (i.e. sufficient range of CrCL values) to evaluate the PK in patients with any degree of renal impairment. The lack of significant effect on baseline CrCL is not sufficient to suggest no dosage adjustment in patients with mild renal impairment. Text that is shaded gray refers to material copied from the applicant’s population PK report. Stepwise Covariate Modeling (SCM) Based on the covariate screening, the following covariates were included in the stepwise covariate analysis for each sequential model of each analyte: For RDV: CL-RDV: WT, age, sex, race, ethnicity, dose, formulation, infusion duration, and BCLCR V1-RDV: WT, age, sex, race, ethnicity, dose, formulation, and infusion duration V2-RDV: WT Q1-RDV: WT F1: formulation For GS-704277: CL-GS-704277: WT, age, sex, race, ethnicity, dose, formulation, infusion duration, and BCLCR V1-GS-704277: WT, age, sex, race, ethnicity, dose, formulation, and infusion duration V2-GS-704277: WT Q1-GS-704277: WT For GS-441524: CL-GS-441524: WT, age, sex, race, ethnicity, dose, formulation, infusion duration, and BCLCR V1-GS-441524: WT, age, sex, race, ethnicity, dose, formulation, and infusion duration V2-GS-441524: WT Q1-GS-441524: WT V3-GS-441524: WT Q2-GS-441524: WT Stepwise Forward Addition and Backward Elimination For RDV, the forward addition resulted in a full model and backward selection did not remove any of the included covariates (Table 22). Next, fixed allometry was explored. Inclusion of fixed allometry was Reference ID: 4672801 found to reduce the object ive function by 60 points compared to the mode l selected fo llowing SCM. This improvement of the overall fit of the mode l with no additional df was considered superior and was therefore reta ined in the mode l for RDV. Although deemed significant during the covariate analysis, BCLCR on CL-RDV was found to be insignificant after the inclusion of allometric WT exponents. The BCLCR remo val resulted in an objective funct ion increase of 2 OFV points. This reduction in impact is reasonable given the corre lation of WT with BCLCR and the relatively narro w range of BCLCR in HVs. The BCLCR was therefore removed from the mode l. Subject ethn icity impacted CL-RDV by only 12.7% and was therefore remo ved due to clinical irrelevance (< 20% effect ). Table 22. Summary of Remdesivir SCM.

After further explorat ion, it was found that dose had only a minor effect of approximate ly 13.6% in the dose range of potentia l clinica l interest (between 30 and 225 mg). Dose was therefore remo ved from the GS-704277 sequent ial model as a clinica lly irrelevant covariate (< 20% effect ). Table 23. Summary of GS-704277 SCM.

Fixed allometry was explored from the SCM model. Inclusion of fixed allometry was found to worsen the objective function by 20 points compared to the SCM model. This was accompanied with a reduction of 1 degree of freedom, making this impact just above the backward elimination criteria. Despite this, the allometric GS-441524 model was accepted based on the following rationale: 1) RDV and GS-704277 models included allometry, and the fits were improved in these model scenarios. 2) The worsening of fit was relatively small utilizing allometry in GS-441524 versus having the model from the SCM in which the WT parameter was selected only on the second intercompartmental clearance parameter. The allometric form of the model has a physiological basis. 3) One of the intended uses of the model is for pediatric scaling simulations to estimate analyte exposures. A broadly accepted parsimonious form of body size in the final PPK model is preferable. This decision in the GS-441524 model allowed all analytes to be allometrically scaled in the final model. Once the allometric form of the GS-441524 model was selected, the other covariates selected in the SCM search were found to have reduced significance. The remaining covariates were tested for removal by order of least impact to greatest impact on the PPK model. The significance of BCLCR on CL was reduced to below acceptance criteria (approximately 5 OFV points) and was removed first. After the removal of BCLCR on CL, sex on V1 was next removed due to lack of significance (approximately 6 OFV points). The final non-WT covariate remaining in the model was Hispanic ethnicity. While this parameter had an impact of 24% on elimination CL based on the IIV structure included in the SCM (diagonal matrix), the magnitude of the effect was optimized near approximately 0 upon testing a block structure for IIV. Due to this, the ethnicity parameter was also removed. It is conceded that ethnicity might have some impact on both RDV and GS-441524; the impact is likely no more than 25% and will be re- evaluated when additional data are available.

(Source: Applicant’s Population PK Report, Table 10) Reviewer’s Comments: The applicant’s decisions to retain fixed allometric exponents versus fitted is critical for extrapolation into pediatrics. For the purposes of extrapolation it is good that the objective function values were lower with the fixed allometric relationships compared to the fitted ones as this is consistent with other pediatric PK and dosing experience in adolescents. Final Population PK Model Table 25 provides the final parameter estimates and standard errors associated with the final PPK model. Inclusion of fixed allometry resulted in reduction in IIV between 1% and 9% across analytes or remained unchanged as compared to the base model. Model diagnostics are shown in Figure 11 and Figure 12. The applicant utilized normalized prediction distribution errors (NPDEs) for the full model that utilized the m3 method for data that were below the limit of quantification, Figure 11. Standard goodness-of-fit plots are shown in Figure 12 for the final model fitting without using the m3 method. Reference ID: 4672801 Table 25.

(Source: Applicant's Population PK Report, Figure 31) Reviewer's Comments: The applicant's PPK model for RDV and its two metabolites is acceptable for descriptive labeling and projecting exposures in children down to 12 years of age. Normalized prediction distributions were utilized for diagnostics in place of the standard goodness-of-fit plots for the final model run that utilized M3. These plots and goodness-of-fit plots for the final model without m3 show good distribution about zero or the line of identity suggesting low model misspecification or bias. Additionally, RSE and ETA shrinkage values were generally low(< 10% RSE for fixed effects , <35% RSE for inter-patient variability, and <25% for shrinkage values), providing reassurance in model estimates. Simulations for Pediatric Patients and Comparison to PBPK Model The fina l PPK mode ls were used to simulate the expected exposures (ie, AUCtau, Cmax, and observed drug concentration at the end of the dosing interval [Ctau]) in pediatr ic subjects for all 3 analytes at Day 1 and Day 5 follow ing the proposed adult and pediatr ic dosing regimens for RDV. The simulated regimens (with infusion t ime of 30 minutes) were 200 mg on Day 1 and 100 mg once daily on subsequent days for subjects 2: 40 kg, or 5 mg/kg on Day 1 and 2.5 mg/kg once daily on subsequent days for subjects< 40 kg. The results of the simulations were compared to observed exposure summar ies from Study GS-US-399-5505 in HV and to PBPK predictions {Lutz 2020}. While the PBPK and observed 54 Reference ID 4672801 55 exposures in Study GS-US-399-5505 were overlaid on the PPK allometric predictions, it should be noted that the population analysis considered exposures from pooled data including Studies GS US-399-1812, GS-US-399-1954, and GS-US- 399-5505. The results are presented in Figure 3 and Figure 4 and for Cmax and AUCtau , respectively, for all analytes and in Figure 5 for Ctau for GS-441524. Reviewer’s Comments: The population PK model projections to adolescents appear to be in line with those of the PBPK predictions for those subjects ≥40 kg. These projections suggest the exposures are at least that of the adults and mostly within the adult range for subjects ≥40 kg. These data support the approval of RDV from an efficacy perspective.

Background information on the procedure 1.1. Submission of the dossier The applicant BioNTech Manufacturing GmbH submitted on 30 November 2020 an application for marketing authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Comirnaty, through the centralised procedure falling within the Article 3(1) and point 1 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The eligibility to the centralised procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 23 July 2020. The applicant applied for the following indication: “Active immunisation to prevent COVID-19 disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus, in individuals 16 years of age and older. The use of Comirnaty vaccine should be in accordance with official guidance.” The legal basis for this application refers to: Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application. The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non- clinical and clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature substituting/supporting certain tests or studies. Information on Paediatric requirements Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision P/0480/2020 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP). At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0480/2020 was not yet completed as some measures were deferred. Similarity Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition related to the proposed indication. Conditional marketing authorisation The applicant requested consideration of its application for a Conditional marketing authorisation in accordance with Article 14-a of the above-mentioned Regulation, as it is intended for the prophylaxis of a life-threatening disease. In addition, the above-mentioned medicinal product is intended for use in an emergency situation, in response to public health threats duly recognised by the World Health Organisation and by the Union. New active Substance status The applicant requested the active substance Single-stranded, 5’-capped messenger RNA produced using a cell-free in vitro transcription from the corresponding DNA templates, encoding the viral spike Assessment report EMA/707383/2020 Page 9/140 (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 contained in the above medicinal product to be considered as a new active substance, as the applicant claims that it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union. Scientific advice The applicant did not seek Scientific advice from the CHMP. COVID-19 EMA pandemic Task Force (COVID-ETF) In line with their mandate as per the EMA Emerging Health Threats Plan, the ETF undertook the following activities in the context of this marketing authorisation application: The ETF confirmed eligibility to the rolling review procedure based on the information provided by the applicant and agreed the start of the rolling review procedure.

Scientific discussion 2.1. Problem statement 2.1.1. Disease or condition COVID-19 is caused by SARS-CoV-2, a zoonotic virus that first emerged as a human pathogen in China and has rapidly spread around the world by human to human transmission. In December 2019, a pneumonia outbreak of unknown cause occurred in Wuhan, China. In January 2020, it became clear that a novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was the underlying cause. In early January 2020, the genetic sequence of the 2019-nCoV became available to the World Health Organization (WHO) and public, and the virus was categorized in the Betacoronavirus subfamily. By sequence analysis, the phylogenetic tree revealed a closer relationship to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus isolates than to other coronaviruses that infect humans, including the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus. SARS-CoV-2 infections and the resulting disease COVID-19 have spread globally, affecting a growing number of countries. On 11 March 2020 the WHO characterized the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic. As of 01 December 2020, there have been >63 million globally confirmed COVID-19 cases and >1.4 million deaths, with 191 countries/regions affected. At the time of this marketing application submission, confirmed cases and mortality continue to rise globally. The ongoing pandemic remains a significant challenge to public health and economic stability worldwide. 2.1.2. Epidemiology and risk factors Every individual is at risk of infection as there is no pre-existing immunity to the SARS-CoV-2. Following infection some but not all individuals develop protective immunity in terms of neutralising antibody responses and cell mediated immunity. However, it is currently unknown to what extent and for how long this protection lasts. According to WHO 80% of infected individuals recover without need for hospital care, while 15% develop more severe disease and 5% need intensive care. Increasing age and underlying medical conditions are considered risk factors for developing severe disease. 2.1.3. Aetiology and pathogenesis SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus with four structural proteins. One of them, the Spike protein is a surface protein which binds the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) present on host cells. Therefore, the Spike protein is considered a relevant antigen for vaccine development. It has been shown that antibodies against the Spike protein neutralise the virus and prevent infection. Assessment report EMA/707383/2020 Page 12/140 2.1.4. Clinical presentation and diagnosis The presentation of COVID-19 is generally with cough and fever, with chest radiography showing ground-glass opacities or patchy shadowing. However, many patients present without fever or radiographic changes, and infections may be asymptomatic which is relevant to controlling transmission. For symptomatic subjects, progression of disease may lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring ventilation and subsequent multi-organ failure and death. Common symptoms in hospitalized patients (in order of highest to lowest frequency) include fever, dry cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, myalgias, nausea/vomiting or diarrhoea, headache, weakness, and rhinorrhoea. Anosmia (loss of smell) or ageusia (loss of taste) may be the sole presenting symptom in approximately 3% of individuals who have COVID-19. The US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defined COVID-19 symptoms as including 1 or more of the following: • Fever • New or increased cough • New or increased shortness of breath • Chills • New or increased muscle pain • New loss of taste or smell • Sore throat • Diarrheal • Vomiting • Fatigue • Headache • Nasal congestion or runny nose • Nausea All ages may present with the disease, but notably case fatality rates (CFR) are elevated in persons >60 years of age. For example, in Italy the CFR was 0.3% in adults <40 years of age but 12.8% in adults 70 to 79 years of age and 20.2% in patients ≥80 years of age. Comorbidities are also associated with increased CFR, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension, and chronic respiratory disease. Healthcare workers are overrepresented among COVID-19 patients due to occupational exposure to infected patients. In most situations, a molecular test is used to detect SARS-CoV-2 and confirm infection. The reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test methods targeting SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA are the gold standard in vitro methods for diagnosing suspected cases of COVID-19. Samples to be tested are collected from the nose and/or throat with a swab. Molecular methods used to confirm an active infection are usually performed within a few days of exposure and around the time that symptoms may begin. Assessment report EMA/707383/2020 Page 13/140 2.1.5. Management The management of COVID-19 has developed during 2020, and now includes antiviral therapy (e.g. remdesivir), antibodies administered from convalescent plasma and hyperimmune immunoglobulins, anti-inflammatory agents such as dexamethasone and statins, targeted immunomodulatory agents and anticoagulants. These therapies have shown variable and limited impact on the severity and duration of illness, with different efficacies depending on the stage of illness and manifestations of disease. While care for individuals who have COVID-19 has improved with clinical experience, there remains an urgent and unmet medical need for a prophylactic vaccine during the ongoing pandemic, both for protection of particularly vulnerable groups as well as mitigating the effects of the pandemic at a population level, e.g. to maintain a functioning health care system, and to avoid the social and economic consequences of the stringent measures needed to diminish virus spread. There is currently no approved vaccine in EU for prevention of COVID-19. About the product BNT162b is a mRNA vaccine for prevention of COVID-19. The vaccine is made of a mRNA encoding for the full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (S) encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). The sequence of the S protein was chosen based on the sequence for the “SARS-CoV-2 isolate Wuhan-Hu- 1”, which was available when the program was initiated: GenBank: MN908947.3 (complete genome) and GenBank: QHD43416.1 (spike surface glycoprotein). The active substance consists of a single-stranded, 5'-capped mRNA that is translated into a codon- optimized sequence encoding the spike antigen of SARS-CoV-2. The RNA contains common structural elements optimized for mediating high RNA stability and translational efficiency (see section 2.2). The LNPs protect the RNA from degradation by RNAses and enable transfection of host cells after intramuscular (IM) delivery. The mRNA is translated into the SARS-CoV-2 S protein in the host cell cytosol. The S protein is then expressed on the cell surface where it induces an adaptive immune response. The S protein is identified as a target for neutralising antibodies against the virus and is therefore considered a relevant vaccine component. The vaccine, BNT162b2 (30 µg), is administered intramuscularly (IM) in two 30 µg doses of the diluted vaccine solution given 21 days apart. Intended indication: ‘Active immunisation to prevent COVID-19 disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus, in individuals 16 years of age and older’. Type of Application and aspects on development The applicant requested consideration of its application for a Conditional Marketing Authorisation in accordance with Article 14-a of the above-mentioned Regulation, based on the following criteria: • The benefit-risk balance is positive: According to the Applicant, there is a positive benefit-risk balance for Comirnaty in the active immunisation to prevent COVID-19 disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, in individuals 16 years of age and older. This is based on evidence from the pivotal study C4591001 (also referred to as BNT162-02), a Phase 1/2/3, placebo-controlled, randomized, observer-blind, dose-finding Study investigating the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity, and efficacy of SARS-COV-2 RNA Vaccine Candidates Against COVID-19 in healthy individuals. Assessment report EMA/707383/2020 Page 14/140 The Applicant stated that the available data to date indicate that its vaccine was 95 percent effective and had no serious side effects, showing that the vaccine prevented mild and severe forms of COVID- 19. • It is likely that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data. The Applicant intends to continue the ongoing pivotal Phase 3 study with participants as originally allocated for as long as possible, to obtain long-term data and to ensure sufficient follow-up to support a standard marketing authorisation. In case of availability of any COVID-19 vaccine, the sponsor will appeal to participants to remain in the ongoing study as originally randomized for as long as possible, ideally until a COVID-19 vaccine has full regulatory approval. In all cases, it is intended to follow participants up to the original planned 24 months post-vaccination, regardless of any participants opting to crossover from placebo to active vaccination. The safety and effectiveness of COMIRNATY in individuals <16 years of age have not been established for this application. Four studies in paediatric subjects are planned as laid down in the paediatric investigation plan. A study in pregnant women is also planned in the EU. A Post-Approval Active Surveillance Safety Study to Monitor Real-World Safety of Comirnaty (Study C4591010) will be conducted in the EU using primary data collection that monitors a cohort of vaccinees and evaluates risk of AESIs. The Applicant will also conduct, non- interventional studies (test negative design) of individuals presenting to the hospital or emergency room with symptoms of potential COVID-19 in a real-world setting. These studies will allow to determine the effectiveness of vaccine in a real-world setting and against severe disease, and in specific racial, ethnic, and age groups. • Unmet medical needs will be addressed According to the Applicant, as there is no approved other vaccine in the EU or successful COVID-19 therapy available in the EU, unmet medical need is existing and is likely to be addressed by this vaccine in view of the high level of protection observed in the pivotal clinical trial. • The benefits to public health of the immediate availability outweigh the risks inherent in the fact that additional data are still required. According to the Applicant, Efficacy of COMIRNATY to prevent COVID-19 was demonstrated at the final analysis. The observed VE in each subgroup as defined by age, including elderly ≥ 65 years old, sex, race/ethnicity, country, obese subjects, and subjects at risk due to comorbidities, was overall consistent with the effectiveness of BNT162b2 to protect vaccinees against the disease. The benefit of immediate availability of Comirnaty through conditional marketing authorisation is based on the fact that there is no approved vaccine or successful COVID-19 therapy available in the European Union. An effective vaccine can impact the pandemic at this critical time and a COVID-19 vaccination program implemented soon can likely prevent further pandemic waves and thus substantially reduce mortality due to disease. 2.2. Quality aspects 2.2.1. Introduction The finished product is presented as a concentrate for dispersion for injection containing 225 μg/ 0.45 mL (prior to dilution) of BNT162b2 (5’capped mRNA encoding full length SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein) as active substance (AS).

The product is available in a 2 mL clear vial (type I glass) with a stopper (synthetic bromobutyl rubber) and a flip-off plastic cap with aluminium seal. Pack size: 195 vials. The multidose (5 dose) vial is stored frozen and must be thawed prior to dilution. After thawing, the vaccine should be diluted and used immediately. After dilution with 1.8 mL sodium chloride (0.9%) solution (not supplied), one dose (0.3 mL) contains 30 micrograms of COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine (embedded in lipid nanoparticles). 2.2.2. Active Substance General Information The active substance consists of a single-stranded, 5'-capped mRNA that is translated into a codon- optimised sequence encoding the spike antigen of SARS-CoV-2. The vaccine is based on the spike glycoprotein (S) of SARS-CoV-2. The sequence was chosen based on the sequence for the “Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 isolate Wuhan-Hu-1”. The protein sequence contains two proline mutation, which ensures an antigenically optimal pre-fusion confirmation (P2 S). The RNA does not contain any uridines; instead of uridine the modified N1-methylpseudouridine is used in RNA synthesis. The applicant will provide clarification on the mechanism of action for BNT162b2. Manufacture, process controls and characterisation Manufacturers The active substance is manufactured and controlled by either Wyeth BioPharma Division, Andover, United States or by BioNTech Manufacturing GmbH, Mainz, Germany, and Rentschler Biopharma SE, Laupheim, Germany. During the procedure, a number of issues were highlighted relating to the GMP status of the manufacture of the active substance and of the testing sites of the finished product for the purpose of batch release. These issues were classified as a Major Objection (MO). After further information was obtained from the sites and inspectors, the MO was considered resolved. EU GMP certificates for the manufacturing and testing sites were subsequently obtained. In conclusio n, appropriate manufacturing authorisations and GMP certificates are in place for all active substance and finished product manufacturing sites. Description of manufacturing process and process controls Information on the manufacturing process and process controls for both the Andover and the BNT Mainz & Rentschler manufacturing sites were provided. The manufacturing process of BNT162b2 active substance involves five major steps. The RNA is synthesised from linear DNA via an in vitro transcription (IVT) step. The IVT step is followed by a number of purification and filtration steps. Lastly, the RNA undergoes a final filtration before being dispensed and stored frozen. Assessment report EMA/707383/2020 Page 16/140 Flow diagrams were provided, presenting the process steps, process inputs and the process controls for each step. The purpose of each step in the manufacturing process is sufficiently described. The ranges of hold times and process parameters and routine in-process controls are listed with corresponding acceptance criteria, for each step. It is noted that not all process parameters are listed, but that the lists include all critical and several non-critical process parameters. It is agreed that the key process parameters are described in the dossier. The applicant has agreed to upgrade these parameters to critical process parameters (CPPs) and to include acceptable ranges for these CPPs. Updated information has been submitted during the procedure which comprised modifications of the acceptable ranges of several process parameters and the addition of some controls. The strategy is found acceptable, and the Applicant will provide information on acceptable ranges for some parameters. The active substance is stored between -15°C and -25°C. Transportation using an insulated shipper is qualified and shipping time to finished product manufacturing sites are defined. Shipping validation of the intermediate has been agreed as recommendation. The batch numbering system is sufficiently described. Control of materials An adequate overview of the raw materials and solutions used in the active substance manufacturing process is provided. Representative certificates of analysis have been provided. The submitted information supports the appropriate quality of raw materials. It is recommended that the applicant should implement relevant testing strategies to ensure an adequate microbiological control for the starting materials (REC1) and should implement a relevant testing strategy to ensure that HEPES (Pfizer) raw material, included in the formulation buffer of FP, is free from contaminating RNases (REC2). The description of synthesis of 5’cap and its related impurities were requested during the procedure. Appropriate information was given. The applicant should implement in-house functional activity analytical methods for release testing of enzymes used in the manufacturing process at all relevant manufacturing sites, by Q1 2021 (REC3). The BNT162b2 active substance is manufactured by in vitro transcription using a linear DNA template, produced via plasmid DNA from transformed Escherichia coli cells. The linear DNA template is not part of the final product but defines the sequence of the mRNA product and therefore it is fundamental to ensure the adequate control of the active substance. Changes to the manufacturing process of the linear DNA template (e.g. change to plasmid host cell) may result in a different impurity profile in the active substance. Additional details on the manufacturing process and the control strategy for this starting material, initially only shortly described, have been provided and the dossier will be updated accordingly. The cell banks involved in the plasmid manufacturing process are described. Master cell bank (MCB) and working cell bank (WCB) qualification tests are listed. Relevant specifications are set and data from the current MCB and WCB are provided. The plasmid MCBs and WCBs are enrolled in a cell bank stability program. The strategy is considered adequate, noting that the dossier will be updated as appropriate. A protocol for establishment of future WCBs is provided. Following fermentation, the cells are harvested and chemically lysed to recover the plasmid DNA. After this lysis step, the circular plasmid DNA is purified. The circular plasmid DNA is filtered and stored frozen. The strategy for establishing the initial shelf-life is endorsed and data provided support the proposed shelf life. A list of the raw materials as well as other materials used in the manufacture of the Assessment report EMA/707383/2020 Page 17/140 linear DNA template is provided. All materials used are animal origin free and sourced from approved suppliers. Specifications for the circular plasmid DNA as well as for the DNA linear template are provided. Process- and product-related impurities including host cell genomic DNA, RNA, proteins, endotoxins, bioburden and plasmid isoforms, for the plasmid DNA, are routinely quantified. The reference material is described. Implementation of any changes in the manufacture of the linear DNA template should be applied for in a variation application. Control of critical steps and intermediates Process parameters and tests that are used to control the process and active substance quality are provided. The list of CPPs was provided with corresponding updated acceptable ranges. A summary of the quality attributes with the rationale for the criticality assignment is provided. The rationale for classification into CQA or QA is presented for each attribute and appears reasonable. The in-process test methods are defined and described in the dossier. Acceptable information has been provided on the control system in place to monitor and control the active substance manufacturing process with regard to critical, as well as non-critical operational parameters and in-process tests. Actions taken if limits are exceeded are specified. Process validation The BNT162b2 active substance manufacturing process has been validated adequately. Consistency in production has been shown on full scale commercial process validation/ process performance qualification batches at all sites. All acceptance criteria for the critical operational parameters and acceptance criteria for the in-process tests are fulfilled demonstrating that the purification process consistently produces active substance of reproducible quality that complies with the predetermined specification and in-process acceptance criteria. In comparability studies, a decrease in RNA integrity was observed for the initial Process 2 batches compared to Process 1 batches. This is further discussed in the subsequent section on manufacturing process development. After adjustment of process parameters for CTP and ATP volumes, RNA integrity level is more consistent and verify that the volume adjustments made for ATP and CTP volumes consistently provide reproducible results with RNA integrity levels more similar to levels achieved in Process 1 batches. Since the target volumes for ATP and CTP have been increased, the proven acceptable ranges (PARs) ranges need to be adjusted and the dossier updated accordingly (REC8). The robustness of the DNase digestion step is not considered comprehensively demonstrated although there is routine control of residual DNA impurities at the active substance level. It has been confirmed that studies to enhance the robustness of this step are ongoing and these should be reported (REC7). The finalised indirect filter qualification assessment, according to the applicant, already available and should be provided for evaluation (REC6). Relevant hold times and transport times have been defined and were validated by appropriate studies. The shipping qualification strategy is described in detail and considers both thermal and mechanical aspects of shipping. The shipping procedures and configuration for transport of frozen AS to the Assessment report EMA/707383/2020 Page 18/140 finished product manufacturing sites were validated to maintain product temperature in the acceptable range for a defined duration. A transport verification study is planned and results will be available in Q1/2021. The recommendation to provide shipping performance qualification data has been agreed (REC6). Manufacturing process development Process development changes were adequately summarised. Two active substance processes have been used during the development history; Process 1 (clinical trial material) and Process 2 (commercial process). Details about process differences, justification for making changes, and results from a comparability study are provided. The major changes between active substance process versions were described in the dossier. Batch analysis results showing comparability between non-clinical and clinical batches are provided. Additional characterization of product-related species and their relation to final product specifications will be provided as a specific obligation. Electropherograms were presented demonstrating similarities in the peak pattern of RNA species, but some differences between Process 1 and 2 were also noted. It can therefore not be concluded that identical species are obtained by the processes. It is likely that the fragmented species will not result in expressed proteins, due to their expected poor stability and poor translational efficiency (see below). However, the lack of experimental data on the truncated RNA and expressed proteins does not permit a definitive conclusion and needs further characterisation. Therefore, additional characterisation data remain to be provided as a specific obligation (SO1). Regarding the 5’ cap end of the AS, reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography-UV and mass spectrometry (LC- UV/MS) characterisation confirmed that the 5'-capped and uncapped structures are the same but that there is a slight shift towards higher 5'-capping levels in Process 2. The reported quality attribute ‘capped-intact RNA’ is intended to reflect the proportion of the RNA molecules in the active substance that are a fully intact molecule and have the 5’-cap. It is noted that the capped-intact RNA is not measured, but only calculated from the results of 5’-cap and %RNA integrity tests. Therefore, this argument alone cannot fully confirm the comparability of Process 2 versus Process 1, and further characterisation data and justification of specifications were requested. According to the Applicant, the majority of fragments are expected to be comprised of truncated transcripts including the 5’ region but lacking the 3’ region and poly(A)tail. However, the results indicating a substantial proportion of shorter/truncated mRNA with both cap and poly(A)tail are not in agreement with this statement. Therefore, the Applicant was asked to discuss and justify the obtained results and explain the apparent discrepancy. Additional characterisation data using an orthogonal method with enriched samples for fragmented species was provided. Preliminary characterization data on isolated fragmented species suggests they predominantly include the 5’-cap but lack the poly(A) tail, supporting the hypothesis that most fragments would arise from premature termination in the IVT reaction. The characterisation data are requested to be completed with analysis of the main peak from ion pairing RP-HPLC and analysis of other samples from Process 1 and optimised Process 2 (SO1). The Applicant will continue to evaluate any potential overestimation of poly(A) tail and should characterise fragments for any future AS process changes (SO1). Furthermore, the poly(A)tail of the 3’ end was characterised by LC-UV/MS. While the results were demonstrated to be comparable between Process 1 and Process 2 batches, significant differences were identified. As expected, poly(A) tail heterogeneity was observed both for Process 1 and Process 2 batches. Thus, slight differences in the poly(A)tail pattern were observed when comparing Process 1 Assessment report EMA/707383/2020 Page 19/140 and Process 2 AS batches. The Applicant explains that the redistribution is probably due to the use of a linearised DNA plasmid template in Process 2 instead of a PCR-derived DNA template in Process 1. For both processes, the poly(A)tail is anticipated to be sufficiently long to guarantee stability of the RNA and function in translation. This explanation is considered reasonable by the CHMP. The overall primary sequence of BNT162b2 active substance was demonstrated to be comparable by LC/MS/MS -oligonucleotide mapping. Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy confirmed that the higher- order structure of Process 1 and Process 2 AS batches were comparable. To demonstrate functionality, the protein size after in-vitro expression of BNT162b2 active substance was determined. The expressed protein sizes were demonstrated to be comparable between Process 1 and Process 2 batches. However, further clarification is requested and include correlation with the calculated molecular weights of the intact S1S2 protein should be demonstrated. (SO1). A second comparability study was presented to assess comparability across the Process 2 manufacturing facilities, batches each from the Andover and BioNTech sites were included in the study. In addition, Process 2 batches, planned for clinical supply and for emergency supply in the US market and representative batches from Process 1 were included in the comparison. In conclusion, the Process 2 batches manufactured at the Andover and BioNTech sites were demonstrated to be comparable with respect to identity as monitored by agarose gels and 5’Cap structure characterised by LC-UV and subsequent MS analysis. Furthermore, the primary sequence and the secondary structure was demonstrated to be comparable for all Process 1 and Process 2 batches included in the study. Poly(A) tail length and distribution was investigated by RP-HPLC and MS analysis. All process 2 batches were found comparable, while the Process 1 batches showed a somewhat different poly(A) tail pattern. The expressed protein size after in-vitro expression of BNT162b2 active substance was determined and the results demonstrate comparability between batches. However, the identity of the bands identified by WB are not sufficiently justified and further clarification is requested (SO1). Overall, the submitted data confirm consistent and comparable quality of Process 2 batches manufactured at the Andover and BioNTech sites. Process characterisation studies using scale-down models of individual unit operations, were performed. It should be noted that future changes to any of the process parameters, regardless of the classification of CPP or non-CPP, should be applied for as variation to the terms of the MA. Initially, addition volumes for ATP and CTP were identified as non-CPPs as both were supplied in theoretical excess. Following additional manufacturing campaigns and additional small-scale studies it was shown that these volumes could be limiting, and the ranges were widened at the higher end. It is noted that after the adjustment of these volumes, the percentage of RNA integrity has increased to levels more consistent with Process 1 batches. Nevertheless, since the target volumes for ATP and CTP have been increased to avoid that these nucleotides are rate-limiting in order to increase the percentage of RNA integrity, the PAR ranges need to be adjusted and the dossier updated accordingly (REC8). The acceptable ranges for CPPs will be updated in the dossier. A safety risk assessment for potential process-related impurities included in the active substance process relative to patient safety was performed. The sources of the impurities are sufficiently addressed. Assessment report EMA/707383/2020 Page 20/140 The safety risk assessment strategy involves comparison of the theoretical worst-case concentration of impurities, assuming no removal, to calculated safety concern thresholds. The worst-case levels of residual raw materials and reagents from the BNT162b2 active substance manufacturing process were calculated to be significantly below the pre-determined safety limits. This is found acceptable. Characterisation Analytical characterisation was performed on BNT162b2 active substance manufactured at commercial scale. This is found acceptable. The physico-chemical characterisation involved primary structure, 5’ cap structure, poly(A)tail and higher order structure evaluation. Primary structure was confirmed by oligonucleotide mapping and the orthogonal method, RNA sequencing using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technology. The results confirm the RNA sequence. The 5’-cap and 3’ poly A tail were confirmed by two separate LC-UV/MS- methods. It was demonstrated that the predominant form of the 5’ terminus is the full-length nucleotide sequence with the 5’-Cap. The higher order structure of BNT162b2 mRNA active substance was characterised in solution using biophysical techniques. Overall, state-of-the-art methods were applied for physico-chemical characterisation and the results confirmed the expected sequence and quality attributes. It is recommended that the applicant should comprehensively describe the capability of a specific analytical method to detect lower amounts of product related impurity in the presence of the correct form in the active substance. (REC9). An uncertainty in the characterisation section is that no biological characterisation is presented. In response to questions during the procedure, the applicant has committed to update dossier with the strategy for potency determination and to address relevant functional assays including the in vitro expression (potency) results and results from the analysis of expressed protein size for active substance lot 20Y513C101. It is recommended that the applicant should discuss the results and the assay suitability for a certain method used for biological characterization of protein expression for the active substance (REC10). As described above, the expressed protein size results are currently not sufficiently confirmed and a specific obligation is laid down in the terms of the MA requiring their adequate characterisation (SO1). Process-related and product-related impurities as well as potential contaminants are described. A number of batches were evaluated for impurities, i.e. clinical, initial emergency supply and PPQ batches from both manufacturing sites. The sole product-related impurity addressed is double-stranded RNA, derived from the in-vitro transcription reaction. Results from the active substance batches demonstrate that the level of double stranded RNA is low, acceptable and consistent. In addition to double stranded RNA, there are truncated RNA, also referred to as fragmented species. Truncated RNA is reflected in the AS specification in terms of RNA integrity. However, the characterisation of BNT162b2 AS is currently not found to be complete in relation to a specific parameter. This is especially important considering that the current AS and finished product acceptance criteria allow for a proportion of fragmented species. The Applicant should provide additional data to further characterise the truncated and modified mRNA species present in the finished product. Relevant protein/peptide characterization data for predominant species should be provided (SO1). Assessment report EMA/707383/2020 Page 21/140 Residual DNA template is a process-related impurity derived from the linearised DNA template added to the in-vitro transcription reaction. Residual DNA template is measured as defined in the active substance specification. The levels are controlled by a specification limit which is considered suitably low. The potential contaminants described in this section are endotoxin and bioburden. Acceptable results are shown for the Proteinase K pool, UF retentate pre recovery, UF-product pool and the active substance, for all batches investigated. Specification The active substance specifications contain tests for appearance (clarity, coloration (Ph. Eur.)), pH (Ph. Eur.), content (RNA Concentration) (UV Spectroscopy), Identity of Encoded RNA Sequence (RT-PCR), RNA Integrity (Capillary Gel Electrophoresis), 5’- Cap (RP-HPLC), Poly(A) Tail (ddPCR), Residual DNA Template (qPCR), dsRNA (Immunoblot), Bacterial Endotoxin (Ph. Eur.) and Bioburden (Ph. Eur.). The proposed specification for active substance is considered acceptable for authorisation with respect to the attributes chosen for routine release testing. During the procedure the specification limits for a number of attributes were tightened in response to questions. The length of the poly(A) tails in BNT162b2 active substance is important for RNA stability and translational efficiency and even though comparable results have been reported to date, the poly(A) tail length should be included to the active substance release testing (SO2). The rationale used to establish the acceptance criteria is described in detail and based on a limited data set representative of BNT162b2 active substance manufactured at the intended commercial scale and process. From the available data, mRNA integrity, dsRNA and Poly(A) tail acceptance criteria are considered in relation with batches used in clinical studies and with the demonstrated manufacturing capability and need to be re-assessed and revised as appropriate as further data becomes available (SO2). Potency testing is not included in the control of active substance but instead is performed at the level of finished product release testing. Considering the nature of this product, the approach is endorsed by the CHMP. Analytical methods All analytical methods used for testing of the active substance are sufficiently described in the dossier. The following tests are performed in accordance with Ph Eur chapters; clarity (Ph Eur 2.2.1), colour (Ph Eur 2.2.2), pH (Ph Eur 2.2.3), bacterial endotoxins (Ph Eur 2.6.14) and bioburden (Ph Eur 2.6.12). All non-compendial analytical methods are sufficiently described. These analytical methods were suitably validated against the parameters presented in ICH Q2(R1). The technical procedure for the quantification of the poly(A) tail is considered, in general, sufficiently described but the suitability of this method for the intended purpose remains to be confirmed (SO2). Batch analysis Batch results are presented for active substance batches used for nonclinical toxicology, clinical trials, process performance qualification (PPQ), emergency supply and stability. Assessment report EMA/707383/2020 Page 22/140 In general, the results obtained using the commercial process (Process 2) demonstrate batch to batch consistency with a few exceptions. Reference materials The current reference standard is referred to as the Clinical Reference Material (CRM). A stability protocol is provided. The Applicant has agreed to provide additional information such as protocol on preparation and qualification on the future reference material, as requested (REC12). In future, a two-tiered system for future commercial reference material will be implemented. A primary reference material (PRM) and an initial working reference material (WRM) will be established for the active substance reference material. Container closure The information regarding container closure system is acceptable. Compliance with Ph. Eur. has been verified. Stability Based on the limited stability data presented a shelf-life at -20 ± 5°C can be approved for the active substance when stored in the commercial container closure system. The stability program is designed to follow ICH guidelines. The test methods used are stability indicating. Data from the sites Andover, Mainz, Rentschler are included. It is noted that the Applicant states that testing is currently in progress on the clinical batches and the dossier will be updated with data for these batches, as well as any new data available for the primary process validation batches. Thermal cycling studies have been initiated and a minimum of one process validation batch will be subjected to photostability studies at a future date. Based on the stability data presented a shelf-life at -20 ± 5°C can be approved for the active substance when stored in the commercial container closure system. 2.2.3. Finished Medicinal Product Description of the product and pharmaceutical development The BNT162b2 finished product (FP) is supplied as a preservative-free, 5 dose multidose concentrate to be diluted prior to intramuscular injection. The finished product is a sterile dispersion of RNA- containing lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) in aqueous cryoprotectant buffer. Each vial, containing 0.45 mL of the finished product at pH 6.9 - 7.9 is designed to deliver a total of 5 doses after dilution by addition of 1.8 mL of sterile 0.9% sodium chloride solution to a total volume of 2.25 mL. Each dose contains 30 µg of RNA in 0.3 mL. The overfill in the vial is required to ensure that the full five doses can be removed from the multi-dose vial after dilution and correctly administered, taking account of potential loss of product during these dilution and administration steps. The justification for the overfill is sufficiently discussed and considered to be acceptable. The applicant development data and finished product testing confirm that 5 doses can be consistently extracted from the vial and delivered after dilution. The finished product is supplied in a 2 mL glass vial sealed with a bromobutyl rubber stopper and an aluminum seal with flip-off plastic cap. The full list of excipients is listed above in section 2.2.1; ALC-0315 and ALC-0159 (functional lipids), DSPC and cholesterol (structural lipids), potassium chloride, potassium dihydrogen phosphate, sodium Assessment report EMA/707383/2020 Page 23/140 chloride and disodium phosphate dihydrate (buffer components), sucrose (cryoprotectant) and water for injections. All excipients except the functional lipids ALC-0315 and ALC-0159 and the structural lipid DSPC comply with Ph. Eur. The functional lipid excipients ALC-0315 and ALC-0159, are classified as novel excipients. Both structural lipids DSPC and cholesterol are used in several already approved finished products. A justification was provided for why DSPC is not considered to be a novel excipient. DSPC is used as part of the LNP for the EU approved finished product Onpattro which is administered intravenously in a much higher dose than the intramuscular dose for this product. Additionally; DOPC, a structurally related lipid, is present in finished products approved in the EU for intramuscular administration. It was therefore concluded that the level of information provided for DSPC, is in line with the requirements for a known excipient are sufficient and appropriately justified. The vial, stopper and seal components are compliant with the appropriate Ph. Eur. monographs for primary containers and closures. Formulation development The section on formulation development describes and justifies the chosen formulation and is sufficiently comprehensive. The formulation development studies of the RNA containing lipid nanoparticles have been thoroughly described. The LNPs consists of four lipids, each has a functional or structural purpose. The formed RNA-containing LNPs are solid particles. Furthermore, the accumulated batch-data to date show consistent manufacture of lipid nanoparticles both with respect to size and polydispersity. Lipid-related impurities have been identified in the finished product and have been characterized. An investigation has been initiated and is ongoing to assess and review potential root causes. The outcome of the investigation shall be provided (SO2). Visual particulate matter has occasionally been observed in finished product batches. Characterization data have been presented and the control strategy has been discussed. The data demonstrates that the particles are comprised of components of the finished product formulation. A 100% visual inspection is performed during manufacturing and the automatic inspection system is updated to improve the inspection. Routine release or routine stability data indicate that the propensity of particles to form following storage is low. If particles are observed in the diluted vaccine the vial should be discarded. Novel excipients Two novel excipients are included in the finished product, the cationic lipid ALC-0315 and the PEGylated lipid ALC-0159. Limited information regarding the novel excipients are provided. ALC-0315 (cationic lipid) The ALC-0315 novel excipient is a cationic lipid containing a tertiary amine and two ester moieties, ((4- hydroxybutyl)azanediyl)bis(hexane-6,1-diyl)bis(2-hexyldecanoate). Figure 1 ALC-0315 structure Assessment report EMA/707383/2020 Page 24/140 A brief description of the chemical synthesis is provided. The suppliers are defined in the dossier. A similar manufacturing process is used for ALC-0315 in clinical and commercial finished product batches. In order to confirm the purity profile and ensure comprehensive quality control and batch-to-batch consistency throughout the lifecycle of the finished product, the applicant should provide additional information about the synthetic process and control strategy for the excipient ALC-0315. (SO4) The proposed specification is considered acceptable based on the available data. However, additional information regarding specifications that should be provided (SO4). Stability data from one supplier indicate that ALC-0315 is stable when stored at the recommended storage conditions. Additionally, the excipient is stable at room temperature suitable for use in further manufacturing steps. Stability data from one supplier is considered representative for lipid from another supplier. Lipid related impurities have been observed in some recently manufactured finished product batches, correlated with ALC-0315 lipid batches. The quality of ALC-0315 excipient is considered acceptable based on the available data on condition that specific impurities in the finished product will be further evaluated (SO2). ALC-0159 (PEGylated lipid) The ALC-0159 novel excipient is a PEGylated lipid, 2 [(polyethylene glycol)-2000]-N,N- ditetradecylacetamide. Figure 2 ALC-0159 structure A brief description of the chemical synthesis is provided. The suppliers are defined in the dossier. The same supplier was used during development for clinical phase 1, 2 and 3 studies. The same synthetic route was used for ALC-0159 throughout development of the finished product. In order to confirm the purity profile and ensure comprehensive quality control and batch-to-batch consistency throughout the lifecycle of the finished product, the applicant is requested to provide additional information about the synthetic process and control strategy for the excipient ALC-0159. (SO5) Assessment report EMA/707383/2020 Page 25/140 The proposed specification is considered acceptable based on available data. However, in order to improve impurity control strategy and to ensure batch to batch consistency of the finished product, there are additional information regarding specifications that should be provided (SO5). Stability data indicate that ALC-0159 is stable when stored at the recommended storage conditions. Manufacturing process development The development history of the finished product is sufficiently described. The process has been transferred to commercial facilities for manufacture of later clinical materials, emergency supply and commercial supply. A table on finished product lot genealogy and usage has been provided. The applicant states that comparability is demonstrated in a stepwise approach through a combination of release testing and extended characterization methods. It is agreed that comparability was sufficiently demonstrated with only small differences noted. During the present regulatory procedure, release testing results of a number of recently manufactured GMP-batches was presented. The release data for the GMP-batches are compared to the clinical batches as well as to the results of the emergency supply lots. It is agreed that the differences noted are few and minor for all tests included in the FP specification and that comparability has been sufficiently demonstrated subject to the specific obligations further described, for the attributes tested and given the pandemic situation. In addition, the comparison will be further extended with additional characterization testing on future batches of finished product. The applicant has confirmed that testing will be performed according to the agreed finished product comparability testing protocol and the results will be submitted in the frame of a specific obligation (SO3). A concurrent validation approach will be used due to the urgent need for this product and the pandemic situation. The rationale for this approach has been documented and is agreed. This concurrent approach requires interim reports to be documented for each individual validation run. An overall report per site will be compiled that summarises all evaluations and contains a comparability assessment of the data of all batches manufactured. Finally, a concluding report linked to this plan will be written that summarises all findings from the different validation reports. Process validation (PPQ) for commercial scale batches were initiated, and a summary report from one PPQ validation batch was provided. In summary, given that an acceptable validation program at the commercial facility has been established, and a summary report from one PPQ validation batch was provided, the information on process validation is considered acceptable subject to the agreed specific obligation that the MAH should provide additional validation data (SO3). The development of the manufacturing process is extensively described, and critical process parameters are defined. Process characterisation studies using scale-down models of individual unit operations, were performed. Overall control strategy was presented but some parameters and ranges may be updated after PPQ and additional characterization studies completed. As for assessment of overall control strategy, a complete set of data and information is needed, this document will be assessed when finalised. A time- plan for the provision of the final data set has been agreed with the applicant (SO3). The analytical testing strategy of finished product has changed throughout the development and these changes have been described. Bridging studies have been performed for analytical tests that have been changed or replaced (subvisible particles, identity of encoded RNA sequence and RNA integrity). This is found acceptable. Assessment report EMA/707383/2020 Page 26/140 Container closure system The development of the container closure system is sufficiently presented. The primary packaging is composed of glass vial and rubber stopper and are compliant with the compendial requirements of Ph. Eur. Controlled extraction studies have been performed on the bromobutyl rubber stopper. The applicant will provide the updated results from the leachables study for assessment. (REC13) Microbiological attributes Container closure integrity testing has been performed to demonstrate that the 2 mL container closure presentation is integral. In order to improve the control strategy, the MAH should provide validation results of alternative sterility test i.e. rapid sterility test for assessment before implementation (REC14). Compatibility The studies described have been performed to assess physicochemical stability of the FP after dilution with 0.9% sodium chloride solution in the original glass vial as well with commonly used commercially available administration components and using worst-case conditions for dosage and administration in the clinical setting. The thawed hold time (in-use period) of undiluted finished product has been defined as 5 days at 2-8 °C and 2 hours at up to 30 °C. Results presented support physicochemical stability of FP diluted in 0.9% sodium chloride solution for up to 24 hours at ambient or refrigerated temperatures (2-30°C) following an in-use thawed hold time of up to 5 days at 2-8 °C and 2 hours at 30 °C. Compatibility with dosing components (syringes and needles) has been established for up to 6 hours. Furthermore, a microbiological in-use hold time study has been performed by a challenge test including five compendial micro-organisms. No significant growth (>0.5log10 from the start-point) was observed for any of the microorganisms within 12 hours of inoculation with storage at 20-25°C of diluted FP in 0.9% sodium chloride solution. Therefore, based on the results from the microbiological in-use hold time study, the proposed in-use period for up to 6 hours at ambient temperatures is agreed, as reflected in the product information. Furthermore, it is also stated by the applicant that the in-use period is in alignment with the WHO policy on the use of opened multi-dose vaccine vials (WHO Policy Statement: Multi-dose vial policy (MDVP) – handling of multi-dose vaccine vials after opening, rev 2014). The compatibility of finished product is acceptably demonstrated by the dilution and administration simulation studies performed. Assessment report EMA/707383/2020 Page 27/140 Manufacture of the product and process controls The finished product is batch released by Pfizer Manufacturing Belgium NV, Puurs, Belgium or BioNTech Manufacturing GmbH, Mainz, Germany. The GMP status of the manufacturing and testing sites of the finished product have been confirmed. The finished product manufacturing process includes the following main steps: active substance thawing and dilution, LNP formation and stabilisation, buffer exchange, concentration and filtration, concentration adjustment and addition of cryoprotectant, sterile filtration, aseptic filling, visual inspection, labelling, freezing and storage. Critical manufacturing steps are discussed, and relevant in- process controls are applied. Dossier should be updated to provide more details on increase batch size including range number of AS bag and batches used, configuration of filters filter surfaces used and process controls (REC14). The absence of a test for residuals is considered acceptable. Shipping validation This section gives a summary of the qualification of the shipping process for transport of BNT162b2 finished product by passive thermal shipping containers for air and road shipments at temperature conditions of -90 to -60 °C from the finished product manufacturing and packaging site to dosing sites in the EU. Short periods of time outside of the intended routine shipping condition of -90 to -60 °C during transport and at distribution sites have been defined. The shipping temperature range of -90 to -60 °C is based on available stability data. One thaw and refreeze cycle is allowed during transportation. Time during transportation out of the intended storage and shipping temperature range (-90 to -60 °C) without thaw is allowed for specified times and conditions for multiple transfers and redistribution during shipping with subsequent refreezing to -90 to -60 °C between transfers. The temperature excursion allowances are supported by data. The selected shipping methods include shipping containers designed to maintain product temperature through a combination of insulation and dry ice. The applicant has prior experience with these passive thermal conveyances and has demonstrated that they maintain the -90 to -60 °C temperature range during product shipments, including minor shipping delays and short exposures to extreme temperatures occasionally observed during shipping and handling. All shipments are continuously monitored using temperature data loggers. The overall qualification strategy considered both thermal and mechanical aspects of shipping in passive thermal conveyance, supported by operational qualification and performance qualification testing. A summary of the shipping qualification strategy has been provided. For the passive thermal conveyance, the qualification is focused on the ability of the passive system to maintain the required temperatures with specified phase change materials or dry ice when exposed to ambient temperature profiles for worst-case season. These studies are carried out in laboratory chambers to simulate the summer as worst-case ambient profiles. A simulated distribution study demonstrated finished product and package integrity after exposure to simulated distribution hazard conditions, following the durations outlined in the worst-case extended transport lanes. Results of thermal qualification have met specified acceptance criteria and support shipments of BNT162b2 finished product using the passive thermal conveyance shipping containers either directly or Assessment report EMA/707383/2020 Page 28/140 via qualified distribution centres. Passive thermal conveyance performance qualification and the simulated shipping study finished product impact testing have been performed to complete shipping qualification assessing both thermal and mechanical aspects of shipping. Process parameters for storage and shipping are found acceptable. Media fills Media fills have been performed for the filling line to validate the aseptic filling process and were run in accordance to guidelines. Results have been provided from three consecutive simulation studies and gave satisfactory results without any contaminated units. Results for the media fill cover the maximum process time for the manufacturing of finished product and simulate worst-case manufacturing conditions. The media fill validation demonstrated that aseptic conditions are maintained during the filling process. For the filling line, the maximum time will be established upon completion of media fill qualification studies. This is found acceptable. Verification of in-process test methods Data on verification of in-process test methods was pending at the time of the present regulatory procedure and should be provided during Q2 2021 (REC15). Hold times Hold times have been established. It is noted that any change of this section needs to be submitted to the Agency via a variation application. Process validation plan A FP process validation plan has been provided. A concurrent validation approach will be used due to the urgent need for this product and the pandemic situation. The rationale for this approach has been documented. This concurrent approach requires interim reports to be documented for each individual validation run. An overall report per site will be compiled that summarises all evaluations and contains a comparability assessment of the data of all batches manufactured. Finally, a concluding report linked to this plan will be written that summarises all findings from the different validation reports. It is described in the dossier that commercial scale PPQ-batches will be manufactured during Dec 2020 to Jan 2021 and the applicant has provided a process validation plan. In order to confirm the consistency of the finished product manufacturing process, the applicant should provide additional validation data, by March 2021. (SO3) Filter validation Acceptable information has been provided during the procedure for filter validation on the filters used for sterile filtration, describing the material, pore size and surface area. All study results met the predetermined acceptance criteria and the studies for microbial retention, membrane compatibility, extractable substances and integrity test determination have shown that the filters are appropriate for sterile filtration of the finished product. In addition, the applicant has clarified that the filter used for bioburden reduction is identical to the filters used for sterile filtration. The MAH should provide the results for assessment from the filter validation as soon as they are available (REC23). Control of excipients ALC-0315 and ALC-0159 are novel excipients, not previously used in an approved finished product within EU. Additional information is provided separately in Section A.3 of the dossier. Assessment report EMA/707383/2020 Page 29/140 DSPC is a non-compendial excipient sufficiently controlled by an in-house specification. Cholesterol is sufficiently controlled according to the Ph. Eur. monograph with additional tests for residual solvents and microbial contamination. The other excipients (sucrose, sodium chloride, potassium chloride, disodium phosphate dihydrate, potassium dihydrogen phosphate and water for injection) are controlled according to respective Ph. Eur. monograph. The processing aids ethanol and citrate buffer are controlled according to Ph. Eur. standards and for HEPES and EDTA, reference is made to the active substance. Product specification The release and stability testing specifications for BNT162b2 finished product include tests for Appearance (Visual), Appearance (Visible Particulates), Subvisible Particles (Ph. Eur.), pH (Ph. Eur.), Osmolality (Osmometry), LNP Size (Dynamic Light Scattering), LNP Polydispersity (Dynamic Light Scattering), RNA Encapsulation (Fluorescence assay), RNA content (Fluorescence assay), ALC-0315 content (HPLC-CAD), ALC-0159 content (HPLC-CAD), DSPC content (HPLC-CAD), Cholesterol content (HPLC-CAD), extractable volume (Ph. Eur.), Lipid identities (HPLC-CAD), Identity of encoded RNA sequence (RT-PCR), Potency / in Vitro Expression (Cell-based flow cytometry), RNA Integrity (Capillary Gel Electrophoresis), Bacterial Endotoxin (Ph. Eur.), Sterility (Ph. Eur.) and Container Closure Integrity (Dye incursion). For all quality attributes tested on stability except for RNA integrity, the acceptance criteria for release and stability testing throughout shelf life are the same. The specifications document for finished product in section 3.2.P.5.1 of the dossier includes a comprehensive panel of relevant tests along with corresponding acceptance criteria. With the exception of osmolality, volume of injections in containers, HPLC-CAD (lipid identities) and RT-PCR (identity of encoded RNA sequence), which are performed only at FP release, all other analytical procedures are conducted at release and stability studies for finished product. It is stated by the applicant that the acceptance criteria used for stability during shelf-life will be the same as the acceptance criteria used for lot release. Several questions in relation to the acceptance criteria in the FP specifications were raised during the procedure (i.e. the LNP size, polydispersity, RNA encapsulation, in-vitro expression and RNA integrity). The acceptance criteria were tightened. For potency, RNA integrity, RNA encapsulation, lipid content and polydispersity index, the acceptance criteria will be re-assessed during Q2 2021 in order to ensure a consistent product quality by providing additional information to enhance the control strategy. This is found acceptable subject to a specific obligation. (SO2) The vial contains an overfill in order to ensure that the full required volume (5 doses) can be delivered following dilution and administration in line with the product information. The finished product specification includes a test to confirm the extractable volume from the vial provides 5 doses. During the procedure the applicant proposed to update the product information and instructions for use to indicate that up to 6 doses can be delivered from the vial. This proposed change to the product information was not considered acceptable as no supporting data were provided to demonstrate that 6 doses can be consistently extracted. In order to support such a change in the product information, a variation should be submitted to update the specification limits for extractable volume, supported by appropriate pharmaceutical development data to support the claim of 6 doses (REC21). A risk evaluation regarding the risk of N-nitrosamines impurities was provided concluding that there is no risk of the presence of nitrosamines in the finished product taking into account the active Assessment report EMA/707383/2020 Page 30/140 substance, the finished product formulation and primary packaging. The risk assessment is considered acceptable. It is recommended that a risk assessment should be provided with respect to the potential presence of elemental impurities in the active product based on the general principles outlined in Section 5.1 of ICH Q3D (REC17). A question was raised during the procedure since no information and discussion was provided in the dossier on lipid-related impurities originating from the degradation of the LNP. It is argued by the applicant that with respect to potential lipid-related impurities originating from the degradation of LNPs, no degradation of the LNP FP has been observed in the stability studies at the recommended storage temperature (-70 to -90 °C) for the LNP as shown by specifications for size and polydispersity, RNA encapsulation, RNA and lipid content and RNA integrity quality attributes. This is acknowledged. In addition, further evaluation of lipid-related impurities in the finished product should be performed and the results submitted and discussed in the frame of a specific obligation (SO2). Analytical methods The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) appropriately validated in accordance with ICH guidelines. Batch analysis The dossier includes release testing results of four recently manufactured GMP-batches. These finished product GMP batches were manufactured at the commercial FP manufacturing site. The release data for these GMP-batches are compared to min-max ranges of the small-scale clinical batches as well as to the results of the emergency supply lots. It is agreed that the differences noted are few and minor for all tests included in the FP specification. Therefore, it can be concluded that comparability has been sufficiently demonstrated for the attributes tested given the pandemic situation and considering that further data is to be provided in the frame of a specific obligation. In addition, the comparison will be further extended with additional characterization testing on future PPQ-batches of finished product. The applicant has confirmed that testing will be performed according to the finished product comparability testing protocol. and the results will be provided in the frame of specific obligation (SO3). Reference materials The finished product reference materials is the same as for active substance. Stability of the product A shelf-life of 6 months for the finished product is proposed when stored at the recommended storage condition of -90°C to -60°C. The applicant has provided stability results up to 6 months at -80 to -60°C of one clinical batch and up to 6 months of a non-clinical batch of finished product. Two weeks data are also provided for two emergency supply under recommended storage conditions. In addition, there are newly initiated stability studies on the recently manufactured GMP-batches as well as plans to initiate stability studies on the future PPQ-batches. Stability data have also been provided at accelerated (-40°C to +5°C) and stressed (+25°C to +30°C) storage conditions. The stability studies are performed in accordance with ICH Q5C (Quality of biotechnological products: Stability testing of biotechnological/biological products) and the same or representative container- Assessment report EMA/707383/2020 Page 31/140 closure system are used in these stability studies as will be used for commercial batches. The test methods used are stability indicating. Overall, the presented stability data indicate no signs of degradation, significant trends or changes in terms of quality at the recommended storage condition (-90 to -60°C). The applicant has provided updated reports from the ongoing stability studies and the presented data are considered sufficient and in support of the shelf-life claim since comparability has been sufficiently demonstrated between commercial scale GMP batches and the small-scale clinical batches. In addition, the initial in-use period for the thawed, undiluted vial is 5 days at 2-8°C followed by storage at up to 30°C for not more than 2 hours. This is found acceptable. Chemical and physical in-use stability has also been demonstrated for 6 hours at 2ºC to 30ºC after dilution in sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection. It is described that the future PPQ-lots will be enrolled in the stability program and the stability protocol has been defined in the dossier. This is acceptable; however, the applicant should commit to provide the 6 months stability data for the PPQ-batches for assessment as soon as they are available. (REC20). Notwithstanding requests for further stability updates, in accordance with EU GMP guidelines, any confirmed out-of-specification result, or significant negative trend, should be reported to the Rapporteur and EMA. It has been clarified by the applicant that results on photostability testing studies will be provided for assessment (REC19). It is recommended that the applicant should investigate the opportunities for an increased temperature at long term storage conditions for the finished product from -70°C to -20°C. In addition, the applicant should investigate the possibility to prolong the in-use storage time (before dilution) of 5 days at 2-8°C as well as the possibilities to extend the claims for transport conditions at 2-8°C (REC22). A shelf-life of 6 months for the finished product at -90 to -60°C is accepted. Adventitious agents Adventitious agents’ safety evaluation has been provided for the AS manufacturing sites and for the finished product manufacturing site. Reagents used in active substance manufacturing and in the establishment of the MCB and WCB are the only materials of animal origin used in the manufacture of BNT162b2. The applicant has identified contamination of the product by Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathy (TSE) agents as the main theoretical risk associated with these ingredients and it is deemed of minimal risk. Additional clarifications were requested and provided for a number of other materials. Sufficient details on the aseptic validation filling and media fills have been provided. Furthermore, adequate testing for bioburden and endotoxin is performed at different stages of the manufacturing process. Therefore, no additional concerns are raised. 2.2.4. Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects During the procedure, a number of issues were highlighted relating to the GMP status of the manufacture of the active substance and of the testing sites of the finished product for the purpose of batch release, the comparability between clinical and commercial material and the absence of validation data on finished product manufactured at the commercial site. These issues were classified as Major Objections (MOs). Assessment report EMA/707383/2020 Page 32/140 After further information was obtained from the sites and inspectors, questions regarding the manufacturing were addressed and manufacturing authorisations and GMP certificates are in place f or all active substance and finished product manufacturing and testing sites. Some of the proposed sites for batch control testing are currently located in the USA. The following time- limited derogation has been introduced as a condition to the MA: ‘In view of the declared Public Health Emergency of International Concern and in order to ensure early supply this medicinal product is subject to a time -limited exemption allowing reliance on batch control testing conducted in the registered site(s) that are located in a third country. This exemption ceases to be valid on 31 August 2021. Implementation of EU based batch control arrangements, including the necessary variations to the terms of the marketing authorisation, has to be completed by the 31 August 2021 at the latest, in line with the agreed plan for this transfer of testing. Progress reports have to be submitted on 31 March 2021 and included in the annual renewal application’. Additional data have been submitted by the applicant during the procedure in response to the other MOs and other questions raised. Having considered the emergency situation and the quality documentation provided, the CHMP imposed some specific obligations (SOs) with clearly defined due dates (refer to Conclusions for details). In addition, the CHMP adopted some Recommendations (RECs) to be addressed by the Applicant. In addition, it should be ensured that, in accordance with Annex I of Directive 2001/83/EC and Article 16 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, the active substance and finished product are manufactured and controlled by means of processes and methods in compliance with the latest state of scientific and technical progress. As a consequence, the manufacturing processes and controls (including the specifications) shall be designed to ensure product consistency and a product quality of at least shown to be safe and efficacious in clinical trials and shall introduce any subsequent changes to their manufacturing process and controls as needed. Active substance Overall, the information provided is satisfactory. However, certain information is still pending due to the very short time frame of product development and will either be updated in the dossier imminently or further addressed in specific obligations and other post-approval measures. Information on the manufacturing process and process controls for the manufacturing sites Andover and BNT Mainz & Rentschler have been provided and are considered satisfactory. Two active substance processes have been used during the development; Process 1 and 2. The major changes between AS Process 1 and 2 are: increased process scale, DNA template changed from a PCR template to linearised plasmid DNA, magnetic bead purification replaced with proteinase K digestion and UFDF steps. Based on the differences observed between batches manufactured by active substance Process 1 and 2 for the CQA mRNA integrity and lack of characterisation data, a MO was raised regarding comparability, characterisation and clinical qualification of the one proposed acceptance criteria. Biological characterisation of the active substance was limited, and additional data and discussion were requested to address functionality. Additional characterisation data for the active substance are to be provided to confirm the identities of the observed Western Blot (WB) bands obtained by the in vitro expression assay (SO1). Truncated RNA species are regarded as product-related impurities and can be expected due to the principle of the in-vitro transcription reaction (i.e. directional polymerase activity) and (theoretical) hydrolysis during manufacturing. Analysis of RNase treated samples showed that all species detected Assessment report EMA/707383/2020 Page 33/140 by the capillary gel electrophoresis (CGE)-based method are composed of RNA. Manufacturing consistency with respect to fragmented species has been sufficiently demonstrated. There were some differences in truncated RNA species level, however further analyses revealed a comparable overall fragmentation profile among Process 1 and Process 2 active substance batches. Additionally, oligonucleotide mapping data demonstrated no significant differences observed between Process 1 and Process 2 active substance batches. The company does not expect truncated transcripts formulated in the finished product to pose a safety or efficacy concern, as in their view no protein expression is expected from truncated transcripts. Further, clinical trials with process 1 material have not revealed major safety concerns to date. Truncated BNT162b2 RNA species lacking either the 5’ cap or the poly(A) tail are expected to be rapidly targeted for degradation in the cytoplasm or would show a decrease or loss of translation efficiency. Preliminary characterization data on isolated fragment species suggest that fragment species predominantly include the 5’-cap but lack the poly(A) tail, supporting the hypothesis that most fragments would arise from premature termination in the IVT reaction. However, as the overall characterisation of the truncated species is still limited, additional analysis of truncated species, additional translated protein characterisation, additional characterisation of lipid- related impurities and potential lipid-RNA species should be provided to support that they are not impacting clinical performance in terms of safety and/or efficacy. The current specification allows for a certain level of truncated mRNA species to be present however data from recent batches have shown levels of truncated species below that level. No related safety issues have been identified in the clinical studies thus far in subjects who received vaccine containing up to a certain level of truncated species. Therefore, the current specification is considered acceptable subject to the submission of additional data in the frame of a specific obligation (SO1). Based on available data, the proposed specification for active substance is acceptable with respect to the attributes chosen for routine release testing. However, the length of the poly(A) tails in BNT162b2 active substance is critical for RNA stability and translational efficiency and therefore should be introduced in active substance release testing in the frame of a specific obligation (SO2). Moreover, the active substance specification acceptance limits should be re-assessed and revised as appropriate, as further data become available from ongoing clinical trials and in line with manufacturing process capability (SO2). It is noted that the Applicant states that testing is currently in progress on the clinical batches and data for these batches, as well as any new data available for the primary process validation batches, will be provided. Based on the limited stability data presented, a shelf-life is approved for the active substance. Finished product The finished product is a preservative-free, multi-dose concentrate to be diluted for intramuscular injection, intended for 5 doses. The finished product is a sterile dispersion of RNA-containing lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) in aqueous cryoprotectant buffer. The formulation development studies of the RNA containing lipid nanoparticles have been thoroughly described including studies that were performed with available active substance, representative of the mRNA platform and included in the finished product. The development of the manufacturing process is extensively described, and critical process parameters are defined. The manufacturing process includes lipid nanoparticle fabrication and bulk finished product formulation followed by fill and finish, and the process has been acceptably described. Assessment report EMA/707383/2020 Page 34/140 Comparability between the commercial finished product and the clinical finished product has been sufficiently demonstrated for the attributes tested and will be subject to a specific obligation. Limited data on the finished product batches manufactured at the commercial facility (entire manufacturing process at the commercial site Pfizer, Puurs, at commercial scale, active substance from process 2) were presented. A process validation plan for PPQ lots has been provided. A concurrent validation approach will be used due to the urgent need for this product and the pandemic situation. The rationale for this approach has been documented. This concurrent approach requires interim reports to be documented for each individual validation run. An overall report per site will be compiled that summarises all evaluations and contains a comparability assessment of the data of all batches manufactured. Finally, a concluding report linked to this plan will be written that summarises all findings from the different validation reports. Further data was requested in order to conclude on the consistency of finished product manufacturing, to assure comparability between the commercial product with the product used in clinical trials, and to support the claimed finished product shelf-life and storage conditions. A process validation plan for PPQ lots has been provided. Process validation (PPQ) for commercial scale batches were initiated, and a summary report from one PPQ validation batch was provided. In summary, given that an acceptable validation program, also comprising the commercial facility at Puurs, Belgium, has been established, and a summary report from one PPQ validation batch was provided, the information on process validation is considered acceptable subject to the agreed specific obligation that the MAH should provide additional validation data (SO3). The specifications for finished product include a comprehensive panel of relevant tests along with corresponding acceptance criteria. Several issues in relation to the acceptance criteria in the finished product specifications were raised, i.e. the LNP size, polydispersity, RNA encapsulation, in-vitro expression and RNA integrity. Whilst FP specifications were subsequently amended and overall found to be acceptable, the acceptance limits should be re-assessed, and revised as appropriate, as further data becomes available from ongoing clinical trials and in line with manufacturing process capability (SO2). Two novel excipients are included in the LNP. Complete information is not provided for both the cationic lipid ALC-0315 and the PEGylated lipid ALC-0159. In order to assure comprehensive control throughout the lifecycle of the finished product and to ensure batch to batch consistency, further information needs to be submitted regarding the synthetic process and control strategy in line with specific obligations (SO4, SO5). Lipid-related impurities have been observed in some recently manufactured finished product batches. For the batches with lipid-related impurities the existing quality control parameters including RNA integrity remain unchanged. Considering the above and the emergency situation, the characterisation of the active substance and finished product is considered acceptable, and the proposed specifications for RNA Integrity and 5’-Cap are considered to be scientifically justified and acceptable. Nevertheless, additional data to complete the characterisation of the active substance and finished product and additional clinical data from batches currently in use in ongoing clinical studies, are considered important to confirm the clinical qualification of these specifications. These data are requested to be provided as specific obligations to the applied conditional marketing authorisation (SO1, SO2). Efficacy, safety and immunogenicity was demonstrated using clinical batches of vaccine from Process 1. The commercial batches are produced using a different process (Process 2), and the comparability of these processes relies on demonstration of comparable biological, chemical and physical characteristics of the active substance and finished product. Assessment report EMA/707383/2020 Page 35/140 The characterisation and control of active substance and finished product are limited in relation to critical quality attributes and impurities. The suitability of the analytical methods used for control of potency and poly(A) tail have not been fully demonstrated. Data demonstrate the presence of significant amounts of truncated/modified forms of mRNA at somewhat higher levels in the batches manufactured with the commercial process as compared to material used in clinical trials. These forms are poorly characterised, and the limited data provided for protein expression do not fully address the uncertainties relating to the risk of translating proteins/peptides other than the intended spike protein. The control strategy for active substance and finished product is important to guarantee acceptable quality and ensure batch to batch consistency of the finished product. Regarding the proposed control strategy, questions were raised both with regard to the suitability of the test methods used and the acceptance criteria for some tests. Based on the above, the following uncertainties are considered to be of importance for the benefit-risk assessment: • Truncated and modified RNA are present as impurities. Considering the low dose of mRNA (30 µg), the impurities are not considered a safety issue based on general toxicological principles. However, when present in the cell there is a possibility that aberrant proteins will be expressed with possibilities for unwanted immunological events. The risk of this occurring is considered low based on the following observations and considerations: o Such impurities were present in the vaccine used in the Phase 3 clinical trials with an acceptable safety profile. Although the lack of characterisation hinders a full comparability evaluation there is no indication that there would be important qualitative differences in the nature of these impurities. o The high levels of these impurities reflect the instability of RNA resulting in generation of RNA fragments both in the transcription step and thereafter. Based on electrophoretic data it appears that there is a diverse set of fragments. Although not confirmed, it is unlikely that these RNA molecules to a large extent would be mRNA molecules with intact 5’-cap and 3’-polyA. o The level of any individual aberrant mRNA species would in any way be magnitudes lower than the level of the intact mRNA and this would be mirrored by the level of protein expression. The amount of the protein would be expected to be too low to elicit an immune response. The spike protein is a highly immunogenic protein and immunodominance would also ascertain that the immune response to the aberrant protein would be non-significant. • Lipid related impurities were observed in recently produced finished product batches. Based on the low dose (30 µg mRNA) it is considered that the amounts of these impurities are too low to be of toxicological significance. 2.2.5. Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects The quality of this medicinal product, submitted in the emergency context of the current (COVID-19) pandemic, is considered to be sufficiently consistent and acceptable subject to the specific obligations abovementioned. In general, physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in an acceptable way. While the characterisation data still Assessment report EMA/707383/2020 Page 36/140 need to be completed, the results of tests carried out indicate consistency of product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that from a quality perspective the product is expected to have a satisfactory clinical performance. The submitted information indicate that currently manufactured product batches are of a quality that is appropriate and sufficiently comparable to that of clinical development batches. However, to ensure that the quality of future batches will also remain appropriate and comparable to that of clinical development batches over the life cycle of the medicinal product a number of issues are expected to be addressed though fulfilment of specific obligations, within defined time frames. The CHMP has identified the following specific obligations to address the identified quality development issues that may have a potential impact on the safe and effective use of the medicinal product, and which therefore are needed to achieve comprehensive pharmaceutical (quality) data and controls for the product. The specific points that need to be addressed in order to fulfil the imposed specific obligations are detailed below. In addition, and in accordance with Article 16 of regulation (EC) No 726/2004, the MAH shall inform the Agency of any information which might influence the quality of the medicinal product concerned, such as any necessary tightening of the finished product specifications earlier than July 2021. This is also related to the general obligation to vary the terms of the marketing authorisation to take into account the technical and scientific progress and enable the medicinal product to be manufactured and checked by means of generally accepted scientific methods. In the context of the conditional marketing authorisation, the applicant should fulfil the following specific obligations (SOs): • SO1: In order to complete the characterisation of the active substance and finished product, the MAH should provide additional data. Due date: July 2021. Interim reports: March 2021. • SO2: In order to ensure consistent product quality, the MAH should provide additional information to enhance the control strategy, including the active substance and finished product specifications.

As regards SO1, the following data are requested in order to complete the information on the active substance and finished product characterisation. a) Additional data is to be provided to further characterise the truncated and modified mRNA species present in the finished product. Data are expected to cover batches used in clinical trials (for which the characterisation data could be available earlier) and the PPQ batches. These data should address results from ion pairing RP-HPLC addressing 5’cap levels and presence of the poly(A) tail. These data should further address the potential for translation into Assessment report EMA/707383/2020 Page 37/140 truncated S1S2 proteins/peptides or other proteins/peptides. Relevant protein/peptide characterization data for predominant species should be provided. Any homology between translated proteins (other than the intended spike protein) and human proteins that may, due to molecular mimicry, potentially cause an autoimmune process should be evaluated.

Due date: July 2021. Interim report: March 2021 c) Additional data for the active substance are to be provided to confirm the identities of the observed Western Blot (WB) bands obtained by the in vitro expression assay. Protein heterogeneity, resulting in broad bands on the WB and uncertainties in the theoretical intact molecular weight of the spike protein, is assumed to be due to glycosylation. Therefore, to further confirm protein identities, enzymatic deglycosylation of the expressed proteins followed by WB analysis should be performed. Correlation with the calculated molecular weights of the intact S1S2 protein should be demonstrated. Due date: July 2021. Interim report: March 2021 As regards SO2, the following data are requested to be provided in order to ensure a comprehensive control strategy, including active substance and finished product specifications: a) The active substance and finished product specifications acceptance limits, should be re- assessed and revised as appropriate, as further data becomes available from ongoing clinical trials and in line with manufacturing process capability and stability data of the product.

Recommendations for future quality development In the context of the obligation of the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: Active substance 1. The MAH should implement relevant testing strategies to ensure an adequate microbiological control for the starting materials. 2. The MAH should implement a relevant testing strategy to ensure that HEPES (Pfizer) raw material, included in the formulation buffer of FP, is free from contaminating RNases. 3. The MAH should implement in-house functional activity analytical methods for release testing of enzymes used in the manufacturing process at all relevant manufacturing sites, by Q1 2021. 4. The MAH should reassess the specification for the linear DNA template purity and impurities. The Applicant has already agreed to supply these by Q2 2021. 5. The MAH should perform and document a gap analysis to identify any supplemental qualification needed to align the methods used for the DNA template control with ICH requirements. The gaps identified should be addressed either prior to transferring the methods to relevant sites or during the transfer activities. 6. The MAH should provide active substance process validation data regarding the finalised Assessment report EMA/707383/2020 Page 40/140 indirect filter qualification assessment and the shipping validation between sites. 7. The MAH should provide the results of the studies performed to enhance the robustness of the DNase digestion step. 8. The MAH should tighten the low limits of the proven acceptable ranges for the target volumes for ATP and CTP, to the levels needed to ensure a sufficiently high mRNA integrity in the active substance manufacturing process. 9. The MAH should comprehensively describe the capability of the next generation sequencing technology platform to detect lower amounts of RNA species of alternative sequence in the presence of the correct, more abundant RNA for the active substance. 10. The MAH should discuss the results and the assay suitability for the cell-based flow cytometry and the western blot method used for biological characterization of protein expression for the active substance. 11. The MAH should provide a summary of the validation/verification status of the immunoblot analytical procedure used to detect double stranded RNA (dsRNA) in BNT162b2 active substance. 12. In order to improve the control strategy, the MAH should provide the protocol on preparation and qualification of future primary and working reference standards for the active substance. Finished Product 13. The updated results from the finished product leachables studies should be provided for assessment. 14. In order to ensure batch to batch consistency of the finished product the MAH should expand the description of the manufacturing process with more details. (1) When the batch size is twice the original one, the range number of active substance bags and active substance batches to be thawed, and the number of mixers should be stated. (2) The MAH should confirm the configuration of filters used in finished product manufacture. (3) The surface area of the sterile filter should be adapted to the batch size, unless otherwise justified; (4) process control for RNA content prior to dilution is important, particularly if several runs of TFF are performed in parallel with batch sizes 15. Data on verification of in-process test methods should be provided for assessment during Q1 2021. 16. In order to improve the control strategy, the MAH should provide results of the validation plan phase 2 of the rapid sterility test for assessment before implementation. 17. A risk assessment should be provided with respect to the potential presence of elemental impurities in the active product based on the general principles outlined in Section 5.1 of ICH Q3D and Ph. Eur. monograph Pharmaceutical Preparations (2619). A summary of this risk assessment should be submitted. The risk assessment should cover all relevant elements and sources in accordance with the guideline. The summary must enable a quantitative comparison of observed or predicted levels with the PDE’s given in the guideline. It should contain what is necessary to evaluate the appropriateness and completeness of the risk assessment, including any assumptions, calculations etc. made. The control strategy for elemental impurities should be justified based on the risk assessment. 18. The MAH should provide the protocol on preparation and qualification of future primary and working reference materials for finished product testing. 19.

The applicant should provide the 6 months stability data for the finished product process performance qualification batches for assessment as soon as they are available. 21. This applicant proposed change to the product information to indicate that up to 6 doses can Assessment report EMA/707383/2020 Page 41/140 be delivered from the vial was not considered acceptable as no supporting data was provided. In order to support such a change in the product information, a variation should be submitted to update the specification limits for extractable volume, supported by appropriate pharmaceutical development data to support the claim of 6 doses. 22. The MAH should investigate the opportunities for an increased temperature at long term storage conditions for the finished product from -70 °C to -20 °C. In addition, the MAH should investigate the possibility to prolong the in-use storage time (before dilution) of 5 days at 2-8 °C as well as the possibilities to extend the claims for transport conditions at 2-8 °C. 23. The MAH should provide the results for assessment from the filter validation as soon as they are available. 2.3. Non-clinical aspects GLP inspections The pivotal toxicological studies are stated to be GLP compliant by the Applicant. There were some issues identified during the assessment with repeat-dose toxicity study #38166 regarding the documentation which have led to a study audit GLP inspection conducted by the local German GLP Compliance Monitoring Authority at the facility where the study was performed, in November 2020. All the answers to the issues were acknowledged by the CHMP. The Applicant gave also comments on these issues. In light of all the elements provided, the issues identified were considered resolved. With regard to repeat-dose toxicity study #20GR142 the only major concern identified was resolved with the answers from the Applicant that were considered satisfactory by the CHMP. 2.3.1. Pharmacology The pharmacology dossier is based on initial studies of the functionality of the BNT162b2 (V9) RNA- based product and the encoded SARS-CoV-2 P2 S protein as well as on supporting studies of SARS- CoV-2 P2 S protein structure. This is followed by characterisation of the humoral and cellular immune response in mouse and nonhuman primate upon immunization with BNT162b2 (V9) and ends up with a SARS-CoV-2 challenge study of BNT162b2 (V9) immunized nonhuman primates. No secondary pharmacodynamic, safety pharmacology or pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies have been conducted with BNT162b2 due to the nature of the RNA-based vaccine product, which is according to applicable guidelines (WHO guideline on nonclinical evaluation of vaccines, WHO Technical Report Series, No. 927, 2005). Mechanism of action SARS-CoV-2 infects the body by the use of the Spike protein (S) to attach to specific cell surface receptors, of which the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) may constitute a major part, as recently suggested. In addition to the initial attachment to a host cell, the S protein is also responsible for viral envelope fusion with the host cell membrane resulting in genome release. Due to its indispensable role, the S protein is a major target of virus neutralizing antibodies and has become a key antigen for vaccine development. By immunisation with the modified RNA (modRNA) product BNT162b2, encoding for the S protein, the intention is to trigger a strong and relatively long-lasting production of high affinity virus neutralizing antibodies, which can act through blocking the S-protein and it’s receptor-binding domain (RBD) interaction with host cell receptors but also by opsonisation mediated virus clearance. In addition, the immunisation with BNT162b2 is also intended to elicit a concomitant T cell response of the Th1 type, supporting the B cells responsible for the production of S- specific antibodies and cytotoxic T cells that kill virus infected cells. Assessment report EMA/707383/2020 Page 42/140 The S protein is a trimeric class I fusion protein that exists in a metastable prefusion conformation before engaging with a target cell. BNT162b2 encodes a P2 mutant (P2 S) variant of S where two consecutive proline mutations have been introduced in order to lock the RBD in the prefusion conformation. In addition, BNT162b2 is nucleoside-modified by a substitution of 1-methyl- pseudouridine for uridine and thus its inherent adjuvant activity mediated by binding to innate immune sensors such as toll-like receptors (TLRs) 7 and 8, is dampened, but not abrogated. Furthermore, the structural elements of the vector backbones of the BNT162b2 are optimised for prolonged and strong translation of the antigen-encoding RNA. The potency of the RNA vaccine is further optimised by encapsulation of the RNA into lipid nano particles (LNPs), which protects the RNA from degradation by RNAses and enable transfection of host cells after intramuscular (i.m.) delivery. The functional and ionizable lipid, ALC-0315, is identified as the primary driver of delivery as it allows the LNPs to have a neutral charge in a physiological environment to facilitate internalization; the endosomal environment exhibits a positive charge and therefore triggers the translocation of RNA into the cytosol (Midoux & Pichon, 2015; Hassett et al, 2019; Patel et al, 2019); ALC-0159 is included in the formulation to provide a steric barrier to: 1) facilitate the control of particle size and homogeneity during manufacturing and product storage, and 2) regulate the association of plasma and proteins with the LNP surface. The composition of the LNPs may also affect the distribution of injected BNT162b2. In addition, it cannot be excluded the LNP composition contributes to the overall immunogenicity. Administration of LNP-formulated RNA vaccines IM results in transient local inflammation that drives recruitment of neutrophils and antigen presenting cells (APCs) to the site of delivery. Recruited APCs are capable of LNP uptake and protein expression and can subsequently migrate to the local draining lymph nodes where T cell priming occurs. In general, following endocytosis of LNPs, the mRNA is released from the endosome into the host cell cytosol (Sahay et al, 2010; Maruggi et al, 2019). The process of an RNA vaccine-elicited immune response has been demonstrated in both murine and nonhuman primate models (Pardi et al, 2015; Liang et al, 2017). Primary pharmacodynamic studies Primary pharmacodynamic studies in vitro To confirm the functionality of the BNT162b2 (V9) RNA-based product, protein expression, transfection frequency from BNT162b2 and cell surface expression of the SARS-CoV-2 P2 S protein antigen was assessed. BNT162b2 (V9) transfection of HEK293T cells indicated SARS-CoV-2 P2 S was correctly expressed on the cell surface, as indicated by flow cytometry staining of non-permeabilized cells with an anti-S1 monoclonal antibody. In addition, the cellular localisation of expressed S1 protein was investigated. The S protein co-localized with an ER marker, as detected by immunofluorescence experiments in HEK293T cells expressing BNT162b2-RNA, suggesting the S protein is processed within the ER. In a set of supportive studies, it was investigated whether BNT162b2 RNA encodes for an amino acid sequence that authentically express the ACE2 binding site (RBD). Recombinant P2 S was expressed from DNA encoding for the same amino acid sequence as BNT162b2 RNA encodes for. Flow cytometry staining with spike protein (S) binding agents, as human ACE2 and monoclonal antibodies known to bind to authentic S-protein all indicated an authentically presented P2 S protein and ACE2 binding site. Low nanomolar affinity of P2 S binding to ACE2 PD and B38 mAb was demonstrated with the use of biolayer Interferometry. To further structurally characterize the P2 spike protein, a cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) investigation of purified P2 S, expressed from DNA, was conducted. The cryoEM revealed, according to Assessment report EMA/707383/2020 Page 43/140 the Applicant, a particle population closely resembling the prefusion conformation of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. By fitting a previously published atomic model on to a processed and refined cryoEM dataset, a rebuilt model was obtained showing good agreement with reported structures of prefusion full-length wild type S and its ectodomain with P2 mutations. In the prefusion state the RBD undergo hinge-like conformational movements and can either be in an “up” position (open for receptor binding) or in a “down” position (closed for receptor binding). Three-dimensional classification of the dataset showed a class of particles that was in the conformation one RBD ‘up’ and two RBD ‘down”. This partly open conformation represented 20.4% of the trimeric molecules. The remainder were in the all RBD ‘down’ conformation. Although potent neutralizing epitopes have been described when the RBD is in the “heads down” closed conformation, the “heads up” receptor accessible conformation exposes a potentially greater breadth of neutralizing antibody targets. It is concluded that antibodies to both the up and down conformations will potentially be formed upon immunisation with the P2 S encoding BNT162b2. Primary pharmacodynamic studies in vivo The humoral and cellular immune response following IM administration of BNT162b2 (V9) was investigated in mice and nonhuman primates. The choice and relevance of the mouse for pharmacological animal model studies was based on the in-depth knowledge about the suitability, dosing and immunization regimen of BALB/c mice for RNA-based vaccine development. Non-human primates were chosen as they are a higher-ordered species, more closely related to humans, which may better reflect immune responses in humans. The selection of rats as the toxicology test species is consistent with the World Health Organization (WHO) guidance documents on nonclinical evaluation of vaccines (WHO, 2005). The documents recommend conducting vaccine toxicity studies in a species which mounts an immune response to the vaccine. The Wistar Han (WH) rat developed an antigen- specific immune response following BNT162b2 vaccination. Balb/c, females were immunized IM on day 0 with 0.2, 1 or 5 µg RNA/animal of BNT162b2 (V9), or with buffer alone (n=8). Blood samples were collected on Days 7, 14, 21 and 28 after immunization. The IgG antibody response to SARS-CoV-2- RBD or S1 was analysed by ELISA. Immunization with BNT162b2 induced IgGs that bound to S1 and RBD, as detected by ELISA, and on day 28 after immunization showed a binding affinity of KD 12 nM or 0.99 nM (geometric mean) respectively, as detected by surface plasmon resonance. To further characterise the antibody response to BNT162b2 and its potential capacity to reduce SARS- CoV-2 infections, a pseudo virus type neutralization assay (pVNT) was used as a surrogate of virus neutralization since studies with authentic SARS-CoV-2 requires a BSL3 containment. The pVNT was based on a recombinant replication-deficient vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) vector that had been pseudotyped with SARS-CoV-2 S protein according to published protocols. A dose-dependent increases in SARS-CoV-2-S VSV pseudovirus neutralizing antibodies were observed in sera from BNT162b2- immunized mice. On day 14, the difference of the group treated with 5 µg RNA compared to the buffer control was statistically significant (p = 0.0010). On days 21 and 28, the differences of the groups treated with 1 µg and 5 µg BNT162b2 compared to the buffer control were statistically significant. The relevance of the pseudovirus assay for authentic SARS-CoV-2 was not discussed. For technical reasons, it was not possible to determine a ratio of neutralizing to non-neutralizing antibodies. Immunisation of mice with BNT162b2 also induced IFN-γ secreting cells of both the CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell subsets. This was shown by ELISPOT after ex vivo re-stimulation of splenocytes with an S- protein overlapping peptide pool Day 28 after immunization. Cytokine profiling was also carried out by Multiplex analysis of cytokine release from the Day 28 Splenocytes. High levels of the Th1 cytokines IFNγ and IL-2 but minute amounts of the Th2 cytokines IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13 were detected after re- stimulation with S but not RBD overlapping peptide mix. The much higher immune cellular responses Assessment report EMA/707383/2020 Page 44/140 elicited against the S1 protein compared to the RBD domain could be explained by the presence of significantly more T cell epitopes in the larger full-length S peptide mix (in addition, S1 covers the RBD domain). It should be emphasized that cellular immune reactivity is much more important against S1 than against the RBD domain, where neutralizing antibodies are more important to the latter. In addition, an elevated secretion of TNFα, GM-CSF, IL-1β, IL-12p70 and IL-18 was recorded after re- stimulation. In order to characterize the immunophenotype of B-and T-cells appearing in lymph nodes from mice immunized with BNT162b2 (V9), B- and T-cell subsets in draining lymph node cells were quantified by flow cytometry 12 days after immunization. Higher numbers of B cells were observed in the samples from mice that received BNT162b2 compared to controls. That included plasma cells, class switched IgG1- and IgG2a-positive B cells, and germinal centre B cells. T-cell counts were elevated, particularly numbers of T follicular helper (Tfh) cells, including subsets with ICOS upregulation, which play an essential role in the formation of germinal centres (Hutloff 2015). In the nonhuman primate (rhesus macaques) studies, BNT162b2 (V9) was shown to be immunogenic after intramuscular administration. The serum concentrations of both S1-binding and the SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody titres were at least an order of magnitude higher after BNT162b2 immunization of rhesus macaques than for the panel of SARS-CoV-2 convalescent human sera. In this study, total antibody response is measured using a luminex assay and results expressed on U/ml and for the neutralization assay results are expressed in VNT 50. Antigen specific S-reactive T-cell response after BNT162b2 immunization of the macaques was measured by ELISPOT and ICS. While S-specific T cells were low to undetectable in naïve animals, strong IFNγ but minimal IL-4 ELISpot responses were detected after the second 30 or 100 µg dose of the BNT162b2. Intra cellular staining (ICS) confirmed that BNT162b2 immunization elicited strong S- specific IFNγ producing T cell responses, including a higher frequency of CD4+ T cells that produced IFNγ, IL-2, or TNF-alpha but a lower frequency of CD4+ cells that produce IL-4. An S-specific IFNγ producing CD8+ T cell response was also recorded. A challenge study in rhesus macaques was conducted as nonclinical proof of concept (PoC). Rhesus macaques share a 100% homology with the human ACE2 sequence that interacts with the RBD of the S protein. BNT162b2 (V9) immunized macaques were challenged with SARS-CoV-2 intra nasally and intratracheally 55 days after the second immunization with BNT162b2. Rhesus macaques were immunized on days 0 and 21, in order to align with the clinical vaccination regimen. Some other COVID-19 vaccine candidates have different prime-boost intervals, such as 4 weeks for both ChAdOx1 (Graham et al., 2020) and mRNA-1273 (Corbett et al., 2020). At the time of challenge, SARS-CoV-2 neutralising titres ranged from 260 to 1,004 in the BNT162b2 (V9)-immunized animals. Neutralising titres were undetectable in animals from the control-immunized and sentinel groups. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was monitored by nasal and oropharyngeal (OP) swabs and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). Viral RNA was detected in BAL fluid from 2 of the 3 control-immunized macaques on Day 3 after challenge and from 1 of 3, on Day 6. At no time point sampled was viral RNA detected in BAL fluid from the BNT162b2 (V9)-immunized and SARS-CoV-2 challenged macaques. The difference in viral RNA detection in BAL fluid between BNT162b2-immunized and control-immunized rhesus macaques after challenge is statistically significant (p=0.0014). From control-immunized macaques, viral RNA was detected in nasal swabs obtained on Days 1, 3, and 6 after SARS-CoV-2 challenge; from BNT162b2 (V9)-immunized macaques, viral RNA was detected only in nasal swabs obtained on Day 1 after challenge and not in swabs obtained on Day 3 or subsequently. The pattern of viral RNA detection from OP swabs was similar to that for nasal swabs. No signs of viral RNA detected vaccine-elicited disease enhancement were observed. The viral RNA levels between control-immunized and BNT162b2- immunized animals after challenge were compared by a non-parametric analysis (Friedman’s test), and the p-values are 0.0014 for BAL fluid, 0.2622 for nasal swabs, and 0.0007 for OP swabs. Assessment report EMA/707383/2020 Page 45/140 Despite the presence of viral RNA in BAL fluid from challenged control animals, none of the challenged animals, immunized or control, showed clinical signs of illness (weight change, body temperature change, blood oxygen saturation and heart rate). The Applicant concluded, the absence of clinical signs in any of the challenged animals, immunised or control, despite the presence of viral RNA in BAL fluid from challenged control animals, indicates that the 2-4 year old male rhesus monkey challenge model appears to be an infection model, but not a clinical disease model. However, a further investigation by lung radiograph and computerized tomography (CT) was conducted. Radiographic evidence of pulmonary abnormality was observed in challenged controls but not in unchallenged sentinels nor in challenged BNT162b2-immunized animals except for a CT-score signal in 1 of 6 pre infection and 2 out of six at Day 10/EOP in BNT162b immunised animals. The CT score signal was at the same level as the control at Day 10/EOP. No radiographic evidence of vaccine-elicited enhanced disease was observed. Secondary pharmacodynamic studies No secondary pharmacodynamics studies were conducted with BNT162b2, which is acceptable to the CHMP. Safety pharmacology studies No safety pharmacology studies were conducted with BNT162b2. The Applicant refers to that they are not considered necessary according to the WHO guideline (WHO, 2005). In addition, no findings on vital organ functions have been recorded in the repeat dose toxicology studies. Thus, the absence of safety pharmacology studies is endorsed by the CHMP. Pharmacodynamic drug interactions studies No pharmacodynamics drug interaction studies were conducted with BNT162b2. This is agreeable to the CHMP. 2.3.2. Pharmacokinetics The applicant has determined the pharmacokinetics of the two novel LNP excipients ALC-0315 (aminolipid) and ALC-0159 (PEG-lipid) in plasma and liver as well as their elimination and metabolism in rats. Furthermore, the Applicant has studied the biodistribution of the two novel lipids (in rats) and the biodistribution of a LNP-formulated surrogate luciferase RNA in mice (IV), as well as the biodistribution of a [3H]-Labelled Lipid Nanoparticle-mRNA Formulation in rats (IM). No traditional pharmacokinetic or biodistribution studies have been performed with the vaccine candidate BNT162b2. In study PF-07302048_06Jul20_072424, the applicant has used a qualified LC-MS/MS method to support quantitation of the two novel LNP excipients. The bioanalysis methods appear to be adequately characterized and validated for use in the GLP studies. PK studies with the two novel LNP-excipients ALC-0315 and ALC-0159: Wistar Han rats were IV bolus injected with LNP formulated luciferase-encoding RNA at 1 mg/kg and ALC-0315 and ALC-0159 concentrations at 15,3 mg/kg and 1,96 mg/kg respectively. ALC-0315 and ALC-0159 levels in plasma, liver, urine and faeces were analysed by LC-MS/MS at different time-points up to 2-weeks. Assessment report EMA/707383/2020 Page 46/140 ALC-0315 and ALC-0159 were rapidly cleared from plasma during the first 24 hours with an initial t½ of 1.62 and 1.72 h, respectively. 24 hours post-dosing, less than 1% of the maximum plasma concentrations remained. A slower clearance rate was observed after 24 hours with ALC-0315 and ALC-0159 terminal elimination t½ of 139 and 72.7 h, respectively. Following plasma clearance, the liver appears to be to major organ to which ALC-0315 and ALC-0159 distribute. The applicant has estimated the percent of dose distributed to the liver to be ~60% for ALC- 0315 and ~20% for ALC-0159. The observed liver distribution is consistent with the observations from the biodistribution study and the repeat-dose toxicology, both using IM administration. For ALC-0315 (aminolipid), the maximum detected concentration in the liver (294 μg/g liver) was reached 3 hours after IV injection. ALC-0315 was eliminated slowly from the liver and after 2-weeks the concentration of ALC-0315 was still ~25% of the maximum concentration indicating that ALC-0315 would be eliminated from rat liver in approximately 6-weeks. For ALC-0159 (PEG-lipid), the maximum detected concentration in the liver (15.2 μg/g liver) was reached 30 minutes following IV injection. ALC-0159, was eliminated from the liver faster than ALC-0315 and after 2-weeks the concentration of ALC-0159 was only ~0,04% of the maximum detected concentration. The applicant was asked to discuss the long half-life of ALC-0315 and its effect, discussion on the comparison with patisiran, as well as the impact on the boosts and post treatment contraception duration. The applicant considered that there were no non-clinical safety issues based on the repeat dose toxicity studies at doses (on a mg/kg basis) much greater than administered to humans; this was acceptable to the CHMP. Both patisaran lipids showed an essentially similar PK profile in clinic with a strongly biphasic profile and long terminal half-lives. According to the applicant, it is difficult to further contextualize the pharmacokinetic data and therefore to understand the safety of these molecules, beyond consideration of dose. There is a large dose differential between the human BNT162b2 dose and the dose used in the toxicity studies (300-1000x) which provides an acceptable safety margin. Moreover, according to the Applicant given the large difference in dose between the toxicity studies and the clinically efficacious dose (300-1000x), it is unlikely that the administration of a booster dose will lead to significant accumulation. Finally, the applicant is of the opinion that these results support no requirements for contraception. The CHMP found this position agreeable. While there was no detectable excretion of either lipid in the urine, the percent of dose excreted unchanged in faeces was ~1% for ALC-0315 and ~50% for ALC-0159. Biodistribution of a LNP-formulated luciferase surrogate reporter: To determine the biodistribution of the LNP-formulated modRNA, the applicant did study distribution of the modRNA in two different non-GLP studies, in mice and rats, determined the biodistribution of a surrogate luciferase modRNA formulated with a LNP with identical lipid composition used in BNT162b2 (mouse study) or the biodistribution of a [3H]-Labelled Lipid Nanoparticle-mRNA Formulation (rat study). The mouse study used three female BALB-c mice per group and luciferase protein expression was determined by in vivo bioluminescence readouts using an In Vivo Imaging System (IVIS) following injection of the luciferase substrate luciferine. The readouts were performed at 6h, 24h, 48h, 72h, 6d and 9d post IM injection (intended clinical route) in the right and left hind leg with each 1 μg (total of 2μg) of LNP-formulated luciferase RNA. In vivo luciferase expression was detected at different timepoints at the injection sites and in the liver region indicating drainage to the liver. As expected with an mRNA product, the luciferase expression was transient and decreased over time. Luciferase signals at the injection sites, most likely reflecting distribution to the lymph nodes draining the injection sites, peaked 6h post injection with signals of Assessment report EMA/707383/2020 Page 47/140 approximately 10 000 times of buffer control animals. The signal decreased slowly during the first 72 hours and after 6 and 9 days the signals were further weakened to approximately levels of 18 and 7 times the signals obtained from animals injected with buffer control. The signals from the liver region peaked 6h post injection and decreased to background levels 48h after injection. The liver expression is also supportive of the data from the rat PK study and the findings in the rat repeat-dose toxicological study showing reversible liver vacuolation and increased γGGT levels. The biodistribution was also studied in rats using radiolabeled LNP and luciferase modRNA (study 185350). The radiolabeling data, measuring distribution to blood, plasma and selected tissues, of IM injection of a single dose of 50 μg mRNA over a 48-hour period is considered more sensitive than the bioluminescence method and indicate a broader biodistribution pattern than was observed with bioluminescence. Over 48 hours, distribution from the injection site to most tissues occurred, with the majority of tissues exhibiting low levels of radioactivity. Radioactivity was detected in most tissues from the first time point (0.25 h) and results support that injections site and the liver are the major sites of distribution. The greatest mean concentration was found remaining in the injection site at each time point in both sexes. Low levels of radioactivity were detected in most tissues, with the greatest levels in plasma observed 1-4 hours post-dose. Over 48 hours, distribution was mainly observed to liver, adrenal glands, spleen and ovaries, with maximum concentrations observed at 8-48 hours post-dose. Total recovery (% of injected dose) of radiolabeled LNP+modRNA outside the injection site was greatest in the liver (up to 21.5%) and was much less in spleen (≤1.1%), adrenal glands (≤0.1%) and ovaries (≤0.1%). The mean concentrations and tissue distribution pattern were broadly similar between the sexes. No evidence of vaccine-related macroscopic or microscopic findings were found in the ovaries in the repeat-dose toxicity studies (Study 38166 and Study 20GR142) and no effects on fertility were identified in the DART study. Immunogenicity of a LNP formulated luciferase modRNA: Activation of the innate immune system following IM injection of a LNP-formulated luciferase reporter RNA into mice was assessed in a Luminex-based multiplex assay were serum samples (day -1 (pre), 6 h and day 9) were tested for levels of the following chemokines and cytokines: MCP-1, MIP-1β, TNF-α, IFN-α, IFN- γ, IL-2, Il-6, IL-10, IL1-β, IP-10. The applicant tested 3 different LNPs, all formulated together with luciferase RNA. The results suggest that the LNP formulation used in BNT162b2 (LNP8) slightly increased levels of MCP-1, IL-6, and IP-10 at 6h post immunisation. All chemokine/cytokine levels dropped to background levels at day 9. In addition to innate immune activation, LNP formulated luciferase modRNA was able to induce IFN-γ T-cell responses (when challenged with MHC I-specific luciferase peptide pools) measured in splenocytes isolated from the mice at day 9.The LNP formulated luciferase modRNA did not induce the formation of luciferase-specific IgGs as measured by ELISA. In an additional hPBMC study (R-20-0357), overall, low levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF, IL- 6, IFNγ, IL-1β) and low or medium levels of chemokines (IP-10, MIP-1β, MCP-1) were secreted when assayed in an exploratory in vitro reactogenicity assay using human PBMCs from three donors. IP-10, MIP-1b, MCP-1 were seen to be increased among donors, because of transfection of antigen presenting cells after infection. Metabolism of the two novel LNP-excipients ALC-0315 and ALC-0159: Metabolism studies were conducted to evaluate the two novel lipids in the LNP, ALC-0315 (aminolipid) and ALC-0159 (PEG-lipid). No metabolic studies were performed with the modRNA or the other two lipids of the LNP. Overall, it seems as both ALC-0159 and ALC-0315 are metabolised by hydrolytic Assessment report EMA/707383/2020 Page 48/140 metabolism of the amide or ester functionalities, respectively, and this hydrolytic metabolism is observed across the species evaluated. The metabolism of the novel excipients, ALC-0159 and ALC-0315, were examined in vitro using blood, liver S9 fractions and hepatocytes, all from mouse, rat, monkey and human. The in vivo metabolism was examined in rat plasma, urine, faeces, and liver from a rat pharmacokinetics study where a luciferase-encoding modRNA formulated in an LNP was used. Metabolism of ALC-0315 appears to occur via two sequential ester hydrolysis reactions, first yielding the monoester metabolite followed by the doubly de-esterified metabolite. The monoester metabolite was observed in vitro in rat blood, monkey S9 fraction, and in vivo in rat plasma and rat liver. The doubly de-esterified metabolite was observed in vitro in mouse and rat blood; monkey liver S9 fraction; and in vivo in rat plasma, urine, faeces and liver. Subsequent metabolism of the doubly de- esterified metabolite resulted in a glucuronide metabolite which was observed in urine only from the rat pharmacokinetics study. Additionally, 6-hexyldecanoic acid, the acid product of both hydrolysis reactions of ALC-0315, was identified in vitro in mouse and rat blood; mouse, rat, monkey and human hepatocytes; mouse, rat and human liver S9 fractions; and in vivo in rat plasma. ALC-0315 was stable over 120 min (>93% remaining) in liver microsomes and S9 fractions and over 240 min (>93% remaining) in hepatocytes in all species and test systems. The primary route of metabolism for ALC-0159 appears to involve amide bond hydrolysis yielding N,N- ditetradecylamine. This metabolite was identified in mouse and rat blood as well as hepatocytes and liver S9 from mouse, rat, monkey and human. ALC-0159 was stable over 120 min (>82% remaining) in liver microsomes and S9 fractions and over 240 min (>87% remaining) in hepatocytes in all species and test systems. Excretion of the two novel LNP-excipients ALC-0315 and ALC-0159: Excretion of the two novel lipids in the LNP, ALC-0315 (aminolipid) and ALC-0159 (PEG-lipid) was studied in the rat PK study. No excretion studies were performed with the modRNA or the other two lipids of the LNP which is considered acceptable by the CHMP. While there was no detectable excretion of either lipid in the urine, the percent of dose excreted unchanged in faeces was ~1% for ALC-0315 and ~50% for ALC-0159. Since almost no unchanged ALC-3015 was detected in urine or faeces, metabolism may play a bigger role in the elimination of ALC-0315 than ALC-0159. 2.3.3. Toxicology The toxicological dossier for BNT162b2 is based on a total of three pivotal toxicological experimental studies; two repeat-dose toxicity rat studies and one DART fertility-EFD rat study. The test substance in the repeat-dose toxicity studies is BNT162b2 (100 µg of variant 8 in one study (study 38166) and 30 µg of the clinically relevant variant 9 in the second study (study 20GR142)), which consists of a modified RNA in a lipid nanoparticle (LNP) formulation. The differences between the variants are due to codon optimization. The LNP contains four excipients whereof two are considered novel (ALC-0315 and ALC-0159). Repeat dose toxicity The two general/repeat-dose toxicity studies involved IM exposure of Han Wistar rats to BNT162b2 for a total of 17 days (three weekly administrations) followed by three weeks of recovery. Overall, the Assessment report EMA/707383/2020 Page 49/140 study designs only included a single experimental group each with a variant of BNT162b2 (V8 or V9 variant), with no dose-response assessment or specific experimental groups for the LNP alone or its novel excipients. No test substance-linked mortality or clinical signs were observed (except a slight increase [<1C] in body temperature). No ophthalmological and auditory effects were found. The animal model of choice, the rat, has not been assessed in the pharmacological dossier but a limited absorption/distribution study has been conducted in pharmacokinetics dossier. Immunogenicity was assessed in the toxicology studies. Body weight and food intake: Exposure generated a slight reduction of absolute BW statistically significant at D9 (-6.8% to -11.3%; BNT162b2 V8) alternatively a weak body weight increase reduction [BNT162b2 v9]. No changes in food intake were observed. Gross pathology and organ weights: At 100ug BNT162b2 V8 and 30ug BNT162b2 V9, the tissue at the injection site was thickened/enlarged with oedema and erythema at the end of exposure in a reversible manner. The spleen was enlarged (reversible) with up to 60% for both vaccine variants and doses. There was also an enlargement of the draining and inguinal lymph nodes at 100ug (BNT162b2 V8). Overall, there were signs of a significant immune response which is likely linked to the test substance. There was a trend of slightly enlarged liver in females at 100ug (BNT162b2 V8) but not at 30ug (BNT162b2 V9). Histopathology: At 100ug BNT162b2 V8, there were observations of various inflammatory signs at the injection site (e.g. fibrosis, myofiber degeneration, oede ma, subcutis inflammation and epidermis hyperplasia). Also, there was inflammation of the perineural tissue of the sciatic nerve and surrounding bone in most rats at d17. The bone marrow demonstrated increased cellularity and the lymph nodes showed plasmacytosis, inflammation and increased cellularity. The spleen demonstrated increased haematopoiesis in half the animals at d17. The liver showed hepatocellular periportal vacuolation at d17 (fully reversed during recovery) which may be related to hepatic clearance of ALC0315. Histopathology assessment of 30ug BNT162b2 V9 generated similar results as 100ug BNT162b2 V8 although not on as extensive level (possibly due to a lesser dose). Minimal to moderate inflammation and oedema was observed at the injection site (usually resolved after ~3d). There was minimal to moderate increased plasma cell cellularity in the lymph nodes and germinal center cellularity plus hematopoietic cell cellularity in the spleen at d17 (reversible at end of recovery). There was minimal increase cellularity in the bone marrow. Reversible vacuolisation in the liver was also observed. The Applicant explained that peri-portal liver vacuolization was observed in both pivotal studies but are not related to any microscopic evidence of liver/biliary injury in animals (cellular hypertrophy, inflammation) nor any clinical data from Phase 1 study. Vacuoles are considered by the Applicant to be a result of ALC-0315 accumulation in liver and not PEG. A novel finding at 30ug was minimal extra-capsular inflammation in the joints at d17. Moreover, increases in neutrophils, monocytes, eosinophils and basophils were observed in study 20GR142. For the Applicant, increases in neutrophils, monocytes, eosinophils and basophils observed in the Study 20GR142 were related to the inflammatory/immune response to BNT162b2 administration. Similar findings were also identified in Study 38166 in animals administered 100 μg BNT162b2. The applicant stated that the increases in eosinophils and basophils are a minor component of the inflammatory leukogram, which is dominated by increases in neutrophils. The applicant also informed that characterisation of large unstained cells was not conducted since the identification of these cells does not provide additional information. The CHMP found this agreeable. Immunogenicity: Treatment of rats with 100 ug BNT162b2 V8 generated SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing titers (based on a vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-based pseudovirus neutralization assay) and IgG antibodies against the S1 fragment and the RBD (based on ELISA) in serum samples. Treatment of Assessment report EMA/707383/2020 Page 50/140 rats with 30 ug BNT162b2 V9 generated SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies (not a pseudovirus neutralization assay). Haematology: At 30ug BNT162b2 V9 and 100ug BNT162b2 V8, there was a moderate to strong reduction of reticulocytes (48-74%, not specified for V9) coupled to lowered red cell mass parameters (RBC, HGB, and HCT). There was a moderate to strong increase (>100%) in large unclassified cells [LUC], neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils and fibrinogen that may be related to the inflammatory/immune response. The changes were reversible. No effects on coagulation were observed for V8 whereas a slight increase in fibrinogen was observed with V8 and V9. Clinical pathology: A very strong but reversible increase (>100%) in pro-inflammatory acute phase proteins in the blood (A1AGP, A2M) was seen with both 30ug BNT162b2 V9 and 100ug BNT162b2 V8. Also, indicative of pro-inflammation, a slight to moderate reduced albumin/globulin ratio was seen for both variants. V8 (100ug) exposure generated increased levels of γGT (>200%) and increased γGT enzyme activity and increased AST levels (+ ~19%). V9 (30ug) exposure led to slight to moderate increases in AST and ALP levels (+20-100%), possible indicative of liver effects but no changes in γGT levels. There were no changes in cytokine levels (IFNγ, TNFalpha, Il-1b, Il6, Il-10) after 100ug V8 exposure (not measured for V9). For 100ug V8, there were no changes measured in urine whereas there was a slight-moderate reduction in pH for 30ug V9. Genotoxicity No genotoxicity studies have been provided. This is acceptable as the components of the vaccine formulation are lipids and RNA that are not expected to have genotoxic potential. The novel excipient ALC-0159 contains a potential acetamide moiety. Risk assessment performed by the Applicant indicates that the risk of genotoxicity relating to this excipient is very low based on literature data where acetamide genotoxicity is associated with high doses and chronic administration (≥1000 mg/kg/day). Since the amount of ALC -0159 excipient in the finished product is low (50 µg/dose), its clearance is high and only two administrations of the product are recommended for humans, the genotoxicity risk is expected to be very low. Reproduction Toxicity In the DART study, the test substances used were BNT162b1, BNT162b2 and BNT162b3, which were given to female rats twice before the start of mating and twice during gestation at the human clinical dose (30 µg RNA/dosing day). The test substances were administered intramuscularly (IM) to F0 female Wistar rats 21 and 14 days before the start of mating (M-21 and M-14, respectively) and then on Gestation Day (GD) 9 and GD20, for a total of 4 doses. A subgroup was terminated at GD21 and another (litter) group was terminated at PND21. SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody titers were found in the majority of females just prior to mating (M-14), in most females and foetuses at the end of gestation (GD21), and in most offspring at the end of lactation (PND21). There was transient reduced body weight gain and food consumption after each dose. No effects on the estrous cycle or fertility index were observed. There was an increase (~2x) of pre-implantation loss (9.77%, compared to control 4.09%) although this was within historical control data range (5.1%-11.5%). Among foetuses (from a total of n=21 dams/litters), there was a very low incidence of gastroschisis, mouth/jaw malformations, right sided aortic arch, and cervical vertebrae abnormalities, although these findings were within historical control data. Regarding skeletal findings, the exposed group had comparable to control group levels of presacral vertebral arches supernumerary lumbar ribs, supernumerary lumbar short ribs, caudal vertebrae number < 5). There were no signs of adverse effects on the postnatal Assessment report EMA/707383/2020 Page 51/140 pups (terminated at PND21). It is noted that there is currently no available data on the placental transfer of BNT162b2. This information is reflected in section 5.3 of the SmPC. Local Tolerance No dedicated local tolerance studies have been conducted; however the assessment of local tolerance was performed in repeat-dose toxicity studies. At 100ug BNT162b2 V8, there was mostly slight to moderate oedemas but in some cases severe oedema. The severity increased with the 2nd and 3rd injections. The data for 30ug BNT162b2 V9 exposure indicated less severe but similar effects. 2.3.4. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment In accordance with the CHMP Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447100 Corr 2), due to their nature vaccines and lipids are unlikely to result in a significant risk to the environment. Therefore, environmental risk assessment studies are not provided in this Application for Marketing Authorisation, which is considered acceptable. 2.3.5. Discussion on non-clinical aspects Pharmacology The proposed medicinal product is composed of a modRNA formulated with functional and structural lipids forming lipid nano particles (LNPs), the latter having the purpose to protect the modRNA from degradation and enable transfection of the modRNA into host cells after IM injection. The composition of the LNPs is likely to affect the distribution of injected BNT162b2. In addition, it cannot be excluded the LNP composition contributes to the overall immunogenicity (see also toxicology below). The general immune activating mode of action of LNP-formulated RNA vaccines have been described in the literature. The administration of LNP-formulated RNA results in transient local inflammation that drives recruitment of neutrophils and antigen presenting cells (APCs) to the site of delivery. Recruited APCs are capable of LNP uptake and protein expression and can subsequently migrate to the local draining lymph nodes where T cell priming occurs. In general, following endocytosis of LNPs, the mRNA is released from the endosome into the host cell cytosol (Sahay et al, 2010; Maruggi et al, 2019). The process of an RNA vaccine-elicited immune response has been demonstrated in both murine and nonhuman primate models (Pardi et al, 2015; Liang et al, 2017). Whether other cells than professional APCs may transiently express the vaccine derived spike protein and therefore from a theoretical point of view, as compared to SARS-CoV-2 infected cells, also could potentially be targets for previously primed spike protein reactive cytotoxic T cells, if present, is not known. However, no overt signs of such adverse pharmacological responses have been recorded in the repeat dose toxicity study or in the clinical trials. In the clinical trial, a second dose was administered to patients who had been immunologically primed by the first dose. Moreover, in the clinical trials it appeared around 270 patients that was shown to have been seropositive for SARS-COV-2 before vaccination. In these cases, the expression of the spike protein on host cells occurred in the presence of a primed immune response to the spike protein but no overt adverse pharmacological response has been observed. The low amount of vaccine product in a single dose may limit the distribution of modRNA/LNP mainly to the injection site and to migrating APCs. Due to the transient expression of the modRNA, no persistent expression is expected. Regarding the structural and biophysical characterization of the modRNA, a schematic description shows that 5 different sequences are included in the BNT162b2, of which two being coding sequences. Assessment report EMA/707383/2020 Page 52/140 Concerning the protein expression obtained from the V8 and V9 variants, specific immune responses (total IgG binding Ab + neutralizing Ab) were obtained at significant levels against the Spike S protein in animals with both variants (in mice and rats), indicating the efficiency of the in vivo expression of Spike S protein. An additional study was provided (R-20-0360) further demonstrating in vitro protein expression. Transfection efficiency, expression rate and cellular viability were analysed in HEK293T cells, upon transfection with different constructs (saRNA, uRNA, modRNA V8 and V9). HEK293T cells were efficiently transfected by both modRNA V8 and modRNA V9 with higher transfection rate for V9, but quite similar the expression rate by V8 and V9. Although some of the structural and biophysical characterization of P2 S as a vaccine antigen has been provided, it was investigated in supportive studies based on P2S expressed from DNA and not the product modRNA. While it is not considered to be of critical importance for the assessment in this procedure, it still provides a scientific understanding supporting the nonclinical key studies of humoral and cellular immune response, including SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies, as well as SARS-CoV-2 challenge nonclinical PoC. In-vivo pharmacodynamics: The humoral and cellular immune response following IM administration of BNT162b2 (V9) was investigated in mice and nonhuman primates and was based on the in-depth knowledge about the suitability, dosing and immunization regimen of BALB/c mice for RNA-based vaccine development. Nonhuman primates were chosen as they are a higher-ordered species, more closely related to humans, which may better reflect immune responses in humans. This is accepted but a more in-depth discussion on the suitability of these pharmacological animal models have not been provided (e.g. susceptibility for SARS-CoV-2 infection and similarity to COVID 19 disease; potential bias for Th1- or Th2-skewed responses has been well characterized for certain mice strains). Only single immunisation was conducted in mice, as compared to the clinical 2-dose regimen, which was adequate since only characterization of the immune response, but no challenge study was carried out in mice. Also, no or limited attention to the induction of long-term memory responses nor immunogenicity and protection in aged animals has been paid. That being said, the induction of virus neutralizing antibodies in both mice (VSV-SARS-CoV-2 S) and primates (SARS-CoV-2) indicated that BNT162b2 immunization has the potential to induce neutralizing antibodies also in humans. Thus, vaccination with modRNA is expected to induce robust neutralising antibodies and a concomitant T cell response to achieve protective immunity. In mice, the immune response was assessed by single immunization only. Taking the phenotyping of B and T cells in aggregate, the data indicates a concurrent induction of SARS-CoV-2 S-specific neutralizing antibody titers and a Th1-driven T-cell response by immunization with BNT162b2 (this was also seen in nonhuman primates). Concerning the nonhuman primate (rhesus macaques) studies, the applicant considers the human convalescent serum panel as an assessable benchmark to judge the quality of the immune response to the vaccine; this is accepted by the CHMP. Concerning the characterization of the T cell responses, the Applicant suggests the S-specific IFNγ producing T cell responses, including a high frequency of CD4+ T cells that produced IFNγ, IL-2, or TNF-α but a low frequency of CD4+ cells that produce IL-4, indicates a Th1-biased response occurred after the BNT162b2 (V9) immunization. This reasoning appears acceptable to the CHMP. The role of such a Th1 biased response was put in the context of antigen-specific T-cell responses playing an important role in generation of antigen-specific antibody response as well as in elimination of infected cells to mediate protection against disease. When immunised macaques were challenged with SARS-CoV-2, a clear and statistically significant effect was observed on reduced presence of viral RNA in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and oropharyngeal (OP) swabs. A clear effect was also recorded by blinded X ray scoring of the lungs. A Assessment report EMA/707383/2020 Page 53/140 protective effect is also evident in the CT score Day 3 after challenge, however at Day 10/EOP, there was a CT signal in 2 out of six BNT162b immunized monkeys at the same level as observed in the control group. That signal is of unclear significance since also in 1 out of 6 pre infection BNT162b immunized animals a similar CT-score signal was observed. During this time period the SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing GMT in the BNT162b2-immunised rhesus macaques continued to decrease but remained above the GMT of a human convalescent serum panel. In conclusion of the preclinical pharmacology, the presented data, including immunogenicity, triggering of neutralizing antibodies and Th1 response and reduced presence of viral RNA in challenged animals as well as radiological lung parameters, provide support for the vaccination approach. Due to species differences in the immune system between animal model species and humans, the conclusion whether this candidate vaccine will be sufficiently effective in humans needs to be established in clinical studies. Pharmacokinetic Pharmacokinetic (regarding the two novel LNP excipients): The two novel lipid excipients play different roles in the formulation and have different pharmacokinetics. It is worth to notice that the lipid displaying a persistent kinetic over time in liver is ALC-0315. ALC-0159 is comprised of a polyethylene glycol (PEG) headgroup (~2000 M.Wt.) attached to hydrophobic carbon chains (ie, the lipid anchor). ALC -0159 is present in BNT162 at a low mol% (<2 mol%), and therefore dose, relative to the other lipids. PEGylated lipid can exchange out of the LNP after administration, thus allowing the desired binding of endogenous proteins (eg, Apolipoprotein E) and removing the steric barrier that would otherwise restrict interactions of the LNP with target cells and proteins. ALC-0315 is an ionizable aminolipid in BNT162b2 and is the most important lipid component for efficient self-assembly and encapsulation of the mRNA within the LNP, and for providing successful delivery of mRNA into target cells. The PEG-lipid (ALC-0159) is designed to largely exchange out of the LNP after administration and before uptake into target cells, whereas the aminolipid (ALC-0315) is critical to the efficient intracellular delivery of the mRNA through endosomal uptake and release and must remain with the LNP. ALC-0159 is much mo re hydrophilic, in large part due to the presence of the PEG molecule which is known to be a strongly hydrophilic molecule (Ma et al, 1990). Due to the more hydrophilic and essential neutral nature of this molecule, ALC-0159 has a much lower affinity for tissues and relative to ALC-0315 there will be freer compound available for redistribution from tissue to plasma; thus, elimination will be more rapid. The Applicant pointed out that during the course of the 2 -week pharmacokinetic study, liver concentrations of ALC -0315 fell 4 -fold from their maximum value indicating that 75% of the material delivered to the liver was eliminated over this two-week period. ALC-0315 has no known biology. In the absence of this ‘biological relevance’ the applicant used an estimation of >95% elimination of ALC -0315 to represent the essential elimination from the body. The elimination half-life of ALC-0315 in the liver following IV administration in the rat is approximately 6 -8 days. These data indicate that 95% elimination of ALC-0315 will occur approx. 30-40 days following final administration in the rat. Based on the understanding of the process involved in the terminal half -life, redistribution from tissues into which the lipid nanoparticle is delivered, a similar half-life and time to 95% elimination in human is expected (Mahmood et al, 2010). Examination of the scaling of the comparable lipids (PEG2000-C-DMG, DLin-MC3-DMA) in patisiran indicates that the half -life of these lipids appears to scale with a value approaching the typically used exponent for half -life (0.25). If this is the case for ALC -0315 we may Assessment report EMA/707383/2020 Page 54/140 expect a half-life approximating 20-30 days in human for ALC-0315 and 4-5 months for 95% elimination of the lipid (Mahmood et al, 2010). Both lipids showed an essentially similar PK profile in clinic with a strongly biphasic profile and long terminal half-lives. Given the large difference in dose between the toxicity studies and the clinically efficacious dose (300 - 1000x), it is unlikely that the administration of a booster dose will lead to significant accumulation. This is noted by the CHMP. Biodistribution: Several literature reports indicate that LNP-formulated RNAs can distribute rather non- specifically to several organs such as spleen, heart, kidney, lung and brain. In line with this, results from the newly transmitted study 185350, indicate a broader biodistribution pattern with low and measurable radioactivity in the ovaries and testes. Given the current absence of toxicity in the DART data, the absence of toxicological findings in gonads in the repeat-dose studies and that the radioactivity in the gonads were low (below 0,1% of total dose), the current data does not indicate it to be a safety concern. The relative high dose used in the rats (500x margin to human dose based on weight) also supports a low risk from distribution to the gonads in humans. RNA stability and kinetics are not expected to be the same for all RNAs and are influenced by the nucleosides of the RNA and although expression of the full-length spike (S) protein is expected to follow similar kinetics of that of the luciferase with a transient expression fading over time, it cannot be excluded that differences in stability/persistence of the signal could differ between the luciferase protein and the spike (S) protein. In an additional hPBMC study (R -20-0357), low levels of pro -inflammatory cytokines (TNF, IL-6, IFNγ, IL-1β) and low or medium levels of chemokines (IP-10, MIP-1β, MCP-1) were secreted when assayed in an exploratory in vitro reactogenicity assay using human PBMCs from three donors. The Applicant underlines that no specific general trend in cytokine secretion can be observed, given variability among donors and based on the low numbers of donors in the experiment. Toxicology Although no extensive pharmacological assessment has been conducted in rat (only in mouse and non- human primate), the rat was used as a toxicological animal model in the repeat- dose toxicity studies. The positive neutralization assay results in the repeat-dose toxicity studies demonstrate that V8 and V9 generate an immune response in this species (i.e. SARS-CoV-2 antibodies), partially supporting the use of the rat as an animal model. Other SARS-CoV-2 immune responses in rat remain unclear. The immune responses, especially at the injection sites (e.g. oedema, erythema), seem to increase with each injection in the studies (n=3). There was a marked increase in acute phase proteins, fibrinogen and reduced albumin-globulin ratio (but no increase in cytokines with V8, unclear for V9). There was also a general increase in immune cells (LUC, neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils) and a decrease in red blood cell parameters (reticulocytes, RGB, HGB, HCT). The spleen was enlarged at both 30ug V9 and 100ug V9 and the draining and inguinal lymph nodes were enlarged mostly at 100ug (V8) but also in a few animals at 30ug (V9). Systemic complement activation (which sometimes may be induced by liposomal drugs and biologicals and potentially result in hypersensitivity reactions) was not investigated as no signs indicative of such clinical manifestations were detected. An absence of dose-response designs in the studies increases the difficulty to interpret the effects. Overall, the V8 and V9 test substances invoked a strong but mostly reversible immune-linked response in rats after 17d e xposure. Increases in neutrophils, monocytes, eosinophils and basophils were observed in study 20GR142. For the Applicant, increases in neutrophils, monocytes, eosinophils and basophils observed in the Study 20GR142 were related to the Assessment report EMA/707383/2020 Page 55/140 inflammatory/immune response to BNT162b2 administration. Similar findings were also identified in Study 38166 in animals administered 100 μg BNT162b2. The applicant stated that the increases in eosinophils and basophils are a minor component of the inflammatory leukogram, which is dominated by increases in neutrophils. The Applicant also informed that characterisation of large unstained cells was not conducted since the identification of these cells would not provide additional information. The CHMP agreed with this position. With regards to the vaccine components, only the whole formulation (modified RNA in LNPs) were used, so there is no toxicological data on the LNP alone or its specific novel excipients. The novel LNP components, these are not considered primarily as adjuvant substances. No genotoxicity nor carcinogenicity studies have been provided. The components of the vaccine formulation are lipids and RNA that are not expected to have genotoxic potential. The novel excipient ALC-0159 contains a potential acetamide moiety. Risk assessment performed by the Applicant indicates that the risk of genotoxicity relating to this excipient is very low based on literature data where acetamide genotoxicity is associated with high doses and chronic administration (≥1000 mg/kg/day). Since the amount of ALC -0159 excipient in the finished prod uct is low (50 µg/dose), its clearance is high and only two administrations of the product are recommended for humans, the genotoxicity risk is expected to be very low. As the pharmacokinetic distribution studies in rat demonstrated that a relatively large proportion - second to the levels at the injection site - of the total dose distributes to the liver (up to 18%, and far more than levels seen in spleen [<1.1%], adrenal glands [<0.1%] and ovaries [<0.1%]). While there was no severe pathogenesis in liver, there were some reversible functional hepatic and/or biliary effects with V8 and V9 (enlarged liver, vacuolation, strongly increased γGT levels at >200% and activity, minor-moderate increase in levels of AST and ALP) which may be linked to the LNP. The γGT changes were not observed with 30ug V9, which may be due to variant differences and/or, more likely, a lower dose. The applicant is of the view that the vacuoles are a result of primarily ALC-0315 accumulation in liver. It can be noted that ALC-0159 needs to be lost from the surface of the LNP to facilitate efficient uptake into target cells. At the same time, ALC-0315 is present in the LNP at a high mol% (50 mol%) relative to the other lipids in the BNT162 vaccine, suggesting that this lipid is more likely to be present within the cells (and possibly in the vacuoles). The assessment of the data available as regards to the DART study shows that there is no clear adverse signs on fertility and early embryogenesis effects. There were no effects on the oestrous cycle in dams but there was an ~2x increase in pre-implantation loss (~9.77% vs 4.1% in controls) but these effects are within historical control data (5.1% to 11.5%) so these findings do not raise any specific concern. It can be noted that the choice of rat as an DART animal model is supported by means of the repeat-dose toxicity rat studies which demonstrates an immune response to the vaccine candidates [V8 and V9] and the publication of Bowman et al (2013; PUBMED ID [PMID] 24391099) that reports that foetal-maternal IgG ratios are relatively low during organogenesis but that these ratios approach 1 by the end of gestation in both rat and human. 2.3.6. Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects The applicant sufficiently addressed other concerns raised to be granted MA from a non-clinical perspective. The CHMP is of the view that non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeat dose toxicity and reproductive and developmental toxicity. Assessment report EMA/707383/2020 Page 56/140 Some r ats intramuscularly administered Comirnaty (receiving 3 full human doses once weekly, generating relatively higher exposure in rats due to body weight differences) developed some injection site oedema and erythema and increases in white blood cells (including basophils and eosinophils) which is consistent with an inflammatory response as well as vacuolation of portal hepatocytes without evidence of liver injury. All effects were reversible. These findings are described in SmPC section 5.3. As per guidance, no genotoxicity nor carcin ogenicity studies were performed. The components of the vaccine (lipids and mRNA) are not expected to have genotoxic potential. This is acceptable to the CHMP. Finally, the combined fertility and developmental toxicity study showed that SARS -CoV-2 neutralising antibody responses were present in maternal animals from prior to mating to the end of the study on postnatal day 21 as well as in foetuses and offspring. There were no vaccine -related effects on female fertility, gestation, or embryo-foetal or offspring development up to weaning. The CHMP noted that no data are available on vaccine placental transfer or excretion in milk. 2.4. Clinical aspects 2.4.1. Introduction Pfizer and BioNTech have developed a vaccine that targets SARS-CoV-2, intended to prevent COVID- 19, for which BioNTech initiated a FIH study in April 2020 in Germany (BNT162-01) and Pfizer initiated a Phase 1/2/3 study (C4591001) shortly afterwards in the US which expanded to include global sites upon initiation of the Phase 2/3 part of the study. Phase 1/2 Study BNT162-01 Study BNT162-01 is the ongoing, FIH, Phase 1 dose level-finding study, in which healthy adults 18 to 55 years of age all receive active vaccine. This study is evaluating the safety and immunogenicity of several different candidate vaccines at various dose levels. The protocol was later amended to allow inclusion of older adult participants up to 85 years of age. The available Phase 1 safety and immunogenicity data for adults 18 to 55 years of age are reported in this application. Multiple vaccine candidates are being evaluated in this study. For each vaccine candidate, participants received escalating dose levels (N=12 per dose level) with progression to subsequent dose levels based on recommendation from a Sponsor Safety Review Committee (SRC). Phase 1/2/3 Study C4591001 Study C4591001 is the ongoing, randomized, placebo-controlled, Phase 1/2/3 pivotal study for registration. It was started as a Phase 1/2 study in adults in the US, was then amended to expand the study to a global Phase 2/3 study planning to enrol ~44,000 participants to accrue sufficient COVID-19 cases to conduct a timely efficacy assessment; amended to include older adolescents 16 to 17 years of age, then later amended to include younger adolescents 12 to 15 years of age. In Phase 1, two age groups were studied separately, younger participants (18 to 55 years of age) and older participants (65 to 85 years of age). The study population includes male and female participants deemed healthy as determined by medical history, physical examination (if required), and clinical judgment of the investigator to be eligible for inclusion in the study. Exclusions included screened individuals with high risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 infection due to exposure in the workplace and/or medical conditions that represent risk factors, clinically important prior illness or laboratory abnormalities, serological evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection or current SARS-CoV-2 infection as measured by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Assessment report EMA/707383/2020 Page 57/140 GCP The Applicant claimed that the Clinical trials included in the application were performed in accordance with GCP. The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the Community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. In addition, to seek further reassurance of the GCP compliance of the studies included in this dossier, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, EMA gathered additional information as indicated below from EU and non-EU regulatory authorities, and shared them with the CHMP to be considered in the assessment: • a full inspection report from GCP inspection by Regierungspräsidium Karlsruhe and Paul- Ehrlich-Institut conducted at one of the investigator sites and at a CRO in Germany for the study BNT 162-01; • Establishment Inspection Reports from GCP inspection by Food and Drug Administrations (USA Regulatory Authority) of six investigator sites in USA for study C4591001 (BNT 162-02); • A full inspection Report and the summaries of the outcome from two GCP inspections by the National Administration of Drugs, Foods and Medical Devices (Argentinian Regulatory Authority) conducted at the single site located in Argentina for the study C4591001(BNT 162- 02). Based on the review of clinical data and the above-mentioned reports, CHMP did not identify the need for a GCP inspection of the clinical trials included in this dossier. • Tabular overview of clinical studies Table 1 Overview of the Clinical Development Assessment report EMA/707383/2020 Page 58/140 Table 2 Overview of the pivotal phase 3 study Study ID No. of study centres / locations Design Study Posology Study Objective Diagnosis Incl. criteria Primary Endpoint C4591001 131 United States 9 Turkey 6 Germany 4 South Africa 2 Brazil 1 Argentina. randomized, multinational, placebo- controlled, observer-blind, 2 doses of 30 µg given 21 days apart Primary: To evaluate the efficacy of BNT162b2 against confirmed severe COVID-19 occurring from 7 and 14 days after the 2nd dose in participants with and without evidence of infection before vaccination Healthy volunteers at risk of COVID-19 COVID-19 incidence per 1000 person-years of follow-up based on central laboratory or locally confirmed NAAT in participants with no serological or virological evidence (up to 7 days after receipt of the second dose) of past SARS-CoV-2 infection 2.4.2. Pharmacokinetics Not applicable. 2.4.3. Pharmacodynamics Mechanism of action The nucleoside-modified messenger RNA in the vaccine is formulated in lipid nanoparticles, which enable delivery of the RNA into host cells to allow expression of the SARS-CoV-2 S antigen. The vaccine elicits both neutralizing antibody and cellular immune responses to the spike (S) antigen, which may contribute to protection against COVID-19. Immunogenicity studies For vaccines, pharmacodynamics relates to investigation of immunogenicity. The available data were generated from the phase 1/2 study BNT162-01 conducted in Germany, and from the phase 1 and 2 parts of the phase 1/2/3 study C4591001, conducted in the USA (later phases were multinational). Both studies were designed to choose the optimal vaccine candidate and an appropriate dose and schedule for further studies. Among the four prophylactic SARS-CoV-2 RNA vaccines initially tested the following two candidates were selected for further development: BNT162b1: RNA-lipid nanoparticle (LNP) vaccine containing nucleoside-modified messenger ribonucleic acid (modRNA) that encodes the RBD (receptor-binding domain) BNT162b2: RNA-L NP vaccine containing modRNA that encodes SARS-CoV-2 full-length, P2 mutant (see section 2.2.2), prefusion spike glycoprotein (P2 S). Key features of the two studies are summarised in the below table. Study id BNT162-01 C4591001 Title A multi-site, Phase 1/2, 2-part, dose- escalation trial investigating the safety and immunogenicity of four prophylactic SARS-CoV-2 RNA vaccines against COVID-19 using A Phase 1/2/3, Placebo-Controlled, Randomized, Observer-Blind, Dose- Finding Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, Immunogenicity, and Efficacy of SARS-COV-2 RNA Vaccine Assessment report EMA/707383/2020 Page 59/140 different dosing regimens in healthy adults Candidates Against COVID-19 in Healthy Individuals Design This is an open-label, multi-site, Phase 1/2, 2-part, dose-escalation study. Part A of the study includes the first in human dose and dose ranging groups in healthy adults (aged 18 to 85yrs). This is a Phase 1/2/3, randomized, multinational, placebo-controlled, observer-blind, dose-finding, vaccine candidate–selection, and efficacy study in healthy individuals. The study consists of 2 parts: Phase 1 to identify preferred vaccine candidate(s) and dose level(s); and Phase 2/3 as an expanded cohort and efficacy part. Immunogenicity objectives To describe the immune response in healthy adults after dose 1 only or after both dose 1 and dose 2 measured by a functional antibody titre To describe the immune responses elicited by prophylactic BNT162 vaccines in healthy adults after 1 or 2 doses Study population Healthy adults aged 18 to 55yrs BNT162b1: N=84 (12/group) BNT162b2: N=60 (12/group) Healthy adults aged 56-85 yrs BNT162b1: N=36 (12/group) BNT162b2: N=36 (12/group) Male or female participants between the ages of 18 and 55 years, inclusive, and 65 and 85 years, inclusive Phase 1 comprised 15 participants (randomization ratio of 4:1 so that 12 received active vaccine and 3 received placebo) per group; 13 vaccine groups were studied, corresponding to a total of 195 participants (the 100 μg dose was only used in the younger adult cohort) IMP and dose level BNT162b1: 1μg, 3μg, 10μg, 20μg, 30μg, 50μg, and 60μg. BNT162b2: 1μg, 3μg, 10μg, 20μg, 30μg BNT162b1: 1 0 μg, 20 μg, 30μg, 100 μg BNT162b2: 1 0μg, 20μg, 30μg Placebo: normal saline Dosing frequency Two injections ~21d apart Two injections ~21d apart Immunogenicity endpoints Virus neutralization test (VNT). Antibody binding assay, CMI assays, e.g. ELISpot and intracellular cytokine staining (ICS). SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay S1-binding IgG level assay RBD-binding IgG level assay N- binding antibody assay Endpoints and Assays used to evaluate immunogenicity In Study BNT162-01, immunogenicity was evaluated in Phase 1 using a SARS-CoV-2 serum neutralization assay to determine neutralizing titres and the fold rise in SARS-CoV-2 serum neutralizing titres. Immunogenicity was assessed at Day 1 (before Dose 1) and 7 days after Dose 1 (Day 8); and at Day 22 (before Dose 2) and 7 days, 14 days, and 21 days after Dose 2. Only qualified assays were used. In addition, T cells isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained from Assessment report EMA/707383/2020 Page 60/140 whole blood samples of vaccinated Phase 1 participants were evaluated by enzyme-linked immuno- spot (ELISPOT) and intracellular cytokine staining visualized with fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS). Blood samples were collected from study participants prior to the first vaccine dose and on Day 29 (7 days) after the second vaccine dose. Assessments included cytokines associated with Th1 responses such as IFNγ and IL-2 and those associated with Th2 responses such as IL-4, to analyse the induction of balanced versus Th1-dominant or Th2-dominant immune responses. In Study C4591001, immunogenicity was evaluated in Phase 1 and Phase 2 using a SARS-CoV-2 serum neutralization assay to determine titres and a SARS -CoV-2 RBD - or S1 -binding IgG direct Luminex immunoassay to determine antibody binding levels. Fold rises were assessed also. Only qualified assays were used. In Phase 1, immunogenicity was assessed at Day 1 (before Dose 1) and 7 days after Dose 1; and at Day 21 (before Dose 2) and 7 days, 14 days, and 1 month after Dose 2. Data were summarized for each dose level and age group. In Phase 2, immunogenicity was assessed at Day 1 (before Dose 1) and 1 month after Dose 2. Data were summarized for each age strata group and by evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection at baseline per NAAT (PCR) or N-binding IgG assay. To facilitate interpretation of immunogenicity data generated in Study C4591001, a human convalescent serum (HCS) panel was obtained from Sanguine Biosciences (Sherman Oaks, CA), MT Group (Van Nuys, CA), and Pfizer Occupational Health and Wellness (Pearl River, NY). The 38 sera in the panel were collected from SARS- CoV-2 infected or COVID-19 diagnosed individuals 18 to 83 years of age ≥14 days after PCR-confirmed diagnosis at a time when they were asymptomatic. The serum donors had predominantly had symptomatic infections (35 of 38) including 1 who had been hospitalized. In Phase 3, exploratory immunogenicity assessments are planned at time points up to 24 months, to be reported at a later time. These are the immunogenicity assays that were used in clinical trials: Single-plex Direct Luminex Assay for Quantitation of SARS-CoV-2 S1-binding IgG in Human Serum Single-plex Direct Luminex Assay for Quantitation of SARS-CoV-2 RBD-binding IgG in Human Serum Roche Elecsys SARS-CoV-2 N Binding Antibody Assay mNeonGreen SARS-CoV-2 Microneutralization Assay ELISpot Assay Intracellular Cytokine Staining (ICS) for BNT162b1 and BNT162b2 The SARS -CoV-2 Wuhan-Hu-1 isolate spike glycoprotein (GenBank accession # QHD43416.1) is the reference sequence for the recombinant S1 and RBD proteins used in the Luminex assays. The SARS - CoV-2 neutralisation assay used a previously described strain of SARS-CoV-2 (USA_WA1/2020). Study BNT162-01 Immunogenicity - functional antibody responses (secondary objectives) Functional antibody titre data are available up until Day 43 for younger adults (18 to 55 yrs) dosed with 1, 10, 30, 50, and 60 μg BNT162b1 on Days 1 (all dose levels) and 22 (all dose levels except 60 μg) (n=12 per group). Data are available for the 10 and 30 μg up until Day 50 for younger adults dosed with 1, 10, 20, and 30 μg BNT162b2 on Days 1 and 22 (dose level 1 μg, n=9; dose levels 10, 20, and 30 μg, n=12). Virus neutralizing antibody GMTs for participants aged 18 to 55 years after dosing with BNT162b1, are shown in Figure 3. On Day 22, at 21 d after the first dose, virus neutralizing antibody GMTs had increased in a dose-dependent manner for all dose groups. At 7 d after the second dose (Day 29), neutralizing GMTs showed a strong, dose level dependent booster response. In the 60 μg dose group, Assessment report EMA/707383/2020 Page 61/140 which was only dosed once, neutralizing GMTs remained at a lower level, indicating that a booster dose is necessary to increase functional antibody titres. On Day 43 (21 d after the second dose of BNT162b1), neutralizing GMTs decreased (with exception of the 1 μg dose level). Day 43 virus neutralizing GMTs were 0.7-fold (1 μg) to 3.6-fold (50 μg) those of a COVID-19 HCS panel. The COVID-19 HCS panel is comprised of 38 human COVID-19 HCS sera drawn from individuals aged 18 to 83 yrs at least 14 d after confirmed diagnosis and at a time when the individuals were asymptomatic. Figure 3: BNT162b1 – Functional 50% SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody titers (VN50) – IMM VN50 titers with 95% confidence intervals are shown for younger participants (aged 18 to 55 years) immunized with 1, 10, 30, 50, or 60 μg BNT162b1. Values smaller than the limit of detection (LOD) are plotted as 0.5*LOD. Arrowheads indicate baseline (pre-Dose 1, Day 1) and Dose 2 (Day 22). Dose 2 was not performed in the 60 μg dose group. The dotted horizontal line represents the LOD. IMM = Immunogenicity set; VN50 = 50% SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody titers; HCS = human COVID-19 convalescent serum For virus neutralizing antibody GMTs for participants aged 18 to 55 yrs after dosing with BNT162b2, see Figure 4. Participants dosed with BNT162b2 showed a strong IMP-induced antibody response. Virus neutralizing GMTs were detected at 21 d after Dose 1 (Day 22) and had increased substantially in younger participants (aged 18 to 55 yrs) immunized with ≥3 µg BNT162b2, and older participants (aged 56 to 85 yrs) immunized with 20 µg BNT162b2 by 7 d after Dose 2 (Day 29). Day 29 virus neutralizing GMTs were comparable between the younger and older adult in the 20 µg dose level cohorts. The lowest tested dose of 1 µg BNT162b2 elicited only a minimal neutralizing response in participants aged 18 to 55 yrs.

Neutralisation of different spike protein mutants Different pseudoviruses including RBD sequence variants have been tested in a pseudovirus neutralization assay with sera from BNT162b1-and BNT162b2-immunized participants in the BNT162- 01 study. Efficient neutralization of spike protein mutants was observed with sera from BNT162b1- and BNT162b2-immunized participants demonstrating the neutralization breadth of vaccine-elicited polyclonal antibodies. BNT162b2-induced virus neutralization titers with pseudovirus 50% neutralization titers (pVNT50) across a pseudovirus panel with 19 SARS-CoV-2 spike protein variants including 18 RBD mutants and the dominant spike protein variant D614G. LLOQ = Lower level of quantification (at 300). Data shown as group (total n=5) GMT with 95% CI. Assessment report EMA/707383/2020 Page 63/140 Cell mediated immunity (CMI) CMI were measured in terms of IFNγ- producing CD4+ and CD8+ T cells by ELISpot. Both vaccine candidates elicited clear responses (baseline vs post-dose 2). Further characterisation was determined using intracellular cytokine staining for Th1 cytokines (IFNγ, IL-2) and Th2 cytokines (IL-4). Both vaccine candidates stimulated predominantly Th1 responses, both in CD4 and CD8 T cells. Study C4591001 Methods The statistical analyses of immunogenicity data from Study C4591001 were based on the evaluable immunogenicity populations and all-available immunogenicity populations. Phase 1 and Phase 2 data were reported as the following, for SARS-CoV-2 serum neutralizing titers and SARS-CoV-2 S1-binding and RBD-binding IgG concentrations: • geometric mean titers/concentrations (GMTs/GMCs) • geometric mean-fold rise (GMFR) • geometric mean ratio (GMR) (for Phase 1 only) • proportions of participants with ≥4-fold rise (for Phase 1 only) • antibody titers/levels at defined thresholds (for Phase 2 only) For immunogenicity results of SARS-CoV-2 serum neutralizing titers and S1- or RBD-binding IgG concentrations, GMTs or GMCs were computed with associated 95% CIs. The GMFR was calculated by exponentiating the mean of the difference of logarithm transformed assay results: (later time point) – (earlier time point) with two-sided CIs. The GMR was calculated as the mean of the difference of logarithm transformed assay results: (SARS-CoV-2 serum neutralizing titers) – (SARS-CoV-2 anti-S binding antibody) for each participant, then exponentiating the mean, with two- sided CIs. Results The study set out to evaluate 2 SARS-CoV-2 RNA vaccine candidates, as a 2-dose (separated by 21 days) schedule, at different dose levels (BNT162b1: 10, 20, 30, and 100 μg, BNT162b2: 10, 20, and 30 μg) and in different age groups (18 55 y; 65-85 y), to select a vaccine and dose level for further testing in Phase 2/3. Cut-off date: 24-Aug-2020 (1 month post-dose 2 = D52). Immunogenicity results are available for both adult age groups up to 1 month post-Dose 2 for the BNT162b1 and BNT162b2 vaccine candidates at the 10-µg, 20-µg, and 30-µg dose levels, and up to 7 weeks after Dose 1 of BNT162b1 at the 100-µg dose level (younger age group only). Results for the 7 days after Dose 1 time point are only analysed and presented in the younger age group (18 to 55 years of age) for 10 µg and 30 µg BNT162b1. Immunogenicity results SARS-CoV-2 Neutralizing Titres BNT162b1 In the younger age group, SARS-CoV-2 50% neutralizing GMTs modestly increased by Day 21 after Dose 1 and were substantially increased 7 days after Dose 2 (Day 28) of BNT162b1 (Figure 5). Generally similar trends were observed in the older age group, with higher GMTs observed in the 20-μg and 30-μg dose groups of BNT162b1 compared to the 10-μg dose group (Figure 6). In the older age Assessment report EMA/707383/2020 Page 64/140 group, the SARS-CoV-2 50% neutralizing GMTs were generally lower than the GMTs in the younger age group. Figure 5.

Similar trends were generally observed in the older age group, with higher GMTs observed in the 30-μg dose groups compared to the 20-μg and 10-μg dose groups (Figure 8). In the older age group, SARS- CoV-2 50% neutralizing GMTs were generally lower than the GMTs in the younger age group. Figure 7.

Discussion on clinical pharmacology The choice and dose of vaccine candidate was based on the results of two clinical phase I studies. Immune responses and safety of the two candidates were studied in both studies. The immune responses in terms of neutralising antibody responses clearly demonstrated that two doses resulted in increased geometric mean titres (GMTs) compared to responses after only the first dose. Thus, in the absence of a serological correlate of protection, these data supported that two doses would be needed in adults. The responses were numerically higher in higher dose groups compared to lower doses but did not substantially differ between 10ug and 30ug. The neutralising antibody responses between the two vaccine candidates are considered similar although no formal comparison was made. The responses to the vaccines were higher compared to a pool of human convalescent sera in study BNT162-001. In both studies subjects 55 years of age and older were included as well as younger adults. The responses in elderly were lower compared to younger adults, but the difference is likely of no clinical relevance, also considering the delayed peak. For BNT162b1 and BNT162b2, the S1- and RBD-binding IgG kinetics were comparable to the kinetics of neutralizing antibodies, with lower IgG concentrations in older age group than in younger age group. Further evaluation of antibody persistence is ongoing. Neutralizing antibody titres will be followed until the end of 162 days post-dose 2 for study BNT162-01 and up to 2-years for study C459001. Final study report from study C4591001 is requested to be submitted as soon as available (specific obligation). Assessment report EMA/707383/2020 Page 67/140 Immune responses induced by the vaccine against emerging circulating strains of SARS-CoV-2 will be also be investigated. Effectiveness studies included in the RMP will be important to understand the performance of the vaccine in case of e.g. mutating variants. Efficient neutralization of spike protein mutants including RBD sequence variants was observed with sera from vaccine-immunized study BNT162-01 participants, demonstrating the neutralization breadth of vaccine-elicited polyclonal antibodies. This may be important to consider when facing emerging variants with mutations in the spike proteins, e.g. the UK variant, as the vaccine might still be able to confer sufficient cross-neutralisation. Further characterisation of immune responses was included in study BNT162-001. Cellular immune responses were demonstrated in terms of IFNγ-producing CD4 and CD8 T cells. In addition, a clear Th1-polarised response, i.e. IFNγ/IL-2 ICS and limited IL-4 ICS was shown, which is reassuring in terms of lack of VAED. For the 30 μg dose cohort vaccinated with BNT162b2, CD4 and CD8 cytokine responses showed the same intensity in adults and older adults, whereas for the 30 μg dose cohort vaccinated with BNT162b1, RBD-specific IL-2 producing CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were reduced in older adults. 2.4.5. Conclusions on clinical pharmacology The immune response data overall support the choice of vaccine candidate, BNT162b2, and the choice of a 2-dose schedule of 30 µg. Final study report from study C4591001 is requested to be submitted as soon as available (specific obligation), including data on persistence of immune responses. 2.5. Clinical efficacy 2.5.1.

Outcomes/endpoints Immunogenicity See pharmacodynamics section for description of immunological methods used in phase 1 and 2 of this study. The same methods are used also in phase 3, but results are not yet available. Primary Efficacy Endpoints First primary endpoint: COVID-19 incidence per 1000 person-years of follow-up in participants without serological or virological evidence of past SARS-CoV-2 infection before and during vaccination regimen – cases confirmed ≥7 days after Dose 2. Second primary endpoint: COVID-19 incidence per 1000 person-years of follow-up in participants with and without evidence of past SARS-CoV-2 infection before and during vaccination regimen – cases confirmed ≥7 days after Dose 2. Secondary Efficacy Endpoints COVID-19 confirmed at least 14 days after Dose 2: COVID-19 incidence per 1000 person-years of follow-up in participants either (1) without or (2) with and without serological or virological evidence of past SARS-CoV-2 infection before and during vaccination regimen – cases confirmed ≥14 days after Dose 2. Assessment report EMA/707383/2020 Page 71/140 Severe COVID-19: incidence per 1000 person-years of follow-up in participants either (1) without or (2) with and without evidence of past SARS-CoV-2 infection before and during vaccination regimen – cases confirmed either (1) ≥7 days after Dose 2 or (2) ≥14 days after Dose 2. COVID-19 Case Definitions Participants who developed any potential COVID-19 symptoms were to contact the site immediately and, if confirmed, to participate in an in-person or telehealth visit as soon as possible (within 3 days of symptom onset and at the latest 4 days after symptom resolution). At the visit (or prior to the visit, if a self-swab was used), investigators were to collect clinical information and results from local standard-of-care tests sufficient to confirm a COVID-19 diagnosis. Investigators were to obtain a nasal swab (mid-turbinate) for testing at a central laboratory using a validated reverse transcription– polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test (Cepheid; FDA approved under EUA) to detect SARS-CoV-2. If the evaluation was conducted by telehealth, the participant was to self-collect a nasal swab and ship for assessment at the central laboratory. A local nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) result was only acceptable if it met protocol specified criteria and if a central laboratory result was not available. Two definitions of SARS-CoV-2 related cases, and SARS-CoV-2 related severe cases, will be considered (for both, the onset date of the case will be the date that symptoms were first experienced by the participant; if new symptoms are reported within 4 days after resolution of all previous symptoms, they will be considered as part of a single illness): Confirmed COVID-19 (defined for FDA guidance): presence of at least 1 of the following symptoms and SARS-CoV-2 NAAT-positive during, or within 4 days before or after, the symptomatic period, either at the central laboratory or at a local testing facility (using an acceptable test): • Fever; • New or increased cough; • New or increased shortness of breath; • Chills; • New or increased muscle pain; • New loss of taste or smell; • Sore throat; • Diarrhoea; • Vomiting. The second definition, which may be updated as more is learned about COVID-19, will include the following additional symptoms defined by the CDC: • Fatigue; • Headache; • Nasal congestion or runny nose; • Nausea. Confirmed severe COVID-19: confirmed COVID-19 and presence of at least 1 of the following: • Clinical signs at rest indicative of severe systemic illness (RR ≥30 breaths per minute, HR ≥125 beats per minute, SpO2 ≤93% on room air at sea level, or PaO2/FiO2<300mm Hg); Assessment report EMA/707383/2020 Page 72/140 • Respiratory failure (defined as needing high-flow oxygen, non-invasive ventilation, mechanical ventilation, or ECMO); • Evidence of shock (SBP <90 mm Hg, DBP <60 mm Hg, or requiring vasopressors); • Significant acute renal, hepatic, or neurologic dysfunction; • Admission to an ICU; • Death. In addition, evidence of prior infection was determined by virological testing via NAAT on mid-turbinate swab and serological testing for IgG to the SARS-CoV-2 N-antigen. A serological definition will be used for participants without clinical presentation of COVID-19: • Confirmed seroconversion to SARS-CoV-2 without confirmed COVID-19: positive N-binding antibody result in a participant with a prior negative N-binding antibody result. In addition, prior infection with SARS-CoV-2 was assessed also at Dose 2 (NAAT) and is being evaluated for up to 24 months. The purpose is to assess persistence of efficacy, explore efficacy against asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections, and ensure safety in both seronegative and seropositive participants. Sample size For Phase 2/3, with assumptions of a true VE of 60% after the second dose of investigational product, a total of approximately 164 first confirmed COVID-19 illness cases will provide 90% power to conclude true VE >30% with high probability, allowing early stopping for efficacy at the IA. This would be achieved with 17,600 evaluable participants per group or 21,999 vaccine recipients randomized in a 1:1 ratio with placebo, for a total sample size of 43,998, based on the assumption of a 1.3% illness rate per year in the placebo group, accrual of 164 first primary-endpoint cases within 6 months, and 20% of the participants being non-evaluable or having serological evidence of prior infection with SARS-CoV-2, potentially making them immune to further infection. Dependent upon the evolution of the pandemic, it is possible that the COVID-19 attack rate may be much higher, in which case accrual would be expected to be more rapid, enabling the study’s primary endpoint to be evaluated much sooner. Randomisation and Blinding (masking) Allocation of participants to vaccine groups were performed through the use of an IRT system (IWR). Participants were randomised 1:1 to active vaccine or placebo. The trial included participants ≥12 years of age, stratified as follows: 12 to 15, 16 to 55 years or >56 years. It was intended that a minimum of 40% of participants were to be enrolled in the >56-year stratum. The study staff receiving, storing, dispensing, preparing, and administering the study interventions were unblinded. All other study and site personnel, including the investigator, investigator staff, and participants, were blinded to study intervention assignments. Exceptions to blinding for e.g. DMC activities were described and found acceptable. Assessment report EMA/707383/2020 Page 73/140 Efficacy Analysis Methods During Phase 2/3, interim analyses were pre-specified in the protocol to be conducted after accrual of at least 62, 92, and 120 evaluable COVID-19 cases, where overwhelming efficacy could be declared if the primary endpoint was met with a posterior probability that the true VE is >30% (i.e., Pr[VE >30%|data] >99.5% at an interim analysis or >98.6% at the final analysis). The success threshold for each interim analysis was calibrated to protect overall type I error at 2.5%. Futility was also assessed, and the study could be stopped for lack of benefit if the predicted probability of demonstrating vaccine efficacy at the final analysis was <5% at any of the first 2 planned interim analyses. Efficacy and futility boundaries were applied in a nonbinding way. The calculation of posterior probability and the credible interval were adjusted for surveillance time. For subgroup analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint, a 2-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated. VE is defined as 100% × (1 – IRR), where illness rate ratio (IRR) is calculated as the ratio of first confirmed COVID-19 illness rate in the vaccine group to the corresponding illness rate in the placebo group. VE is demonstrated if there is convincing evidence (i.e., posterior probability greater than 99.5% at an interim analysis or greater than 98.6% at the final analysis) that the true VE of BNT162b2 is >30% using a beta-binomial model, where VE represents efficacy for prophylactic BNT162b2 against confirmed COVID-19 in participants without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection before and during the vaccination regimen. Participants with positive or unknown NAAT results at any illness visit prior to 7 days after Dose 2 were not included in the evaluation for VE. Cases were counted from 7 days after Dose 2. The interim analysis was performed for the first primary efficacy endpoint only. Other efficacy data analysed for the interim analysis were summarized with descriptive summary statistics, including COVID-19 case counts in the BNT162b2 and placebo groups on the basis of: • evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection at baseline per NAAT or N-antigen binding assay • subgroup status (i.e., age, sex, race, ethnicity baseline SARS-CoV-2 status) • COVID-19 cases meeting protocol criteria as severe after the first and second doses. Overwhelming efficacy success criteria were met at the first interim analysis, so further formal interim analyses would not be conducted. The final analysis of all protocol specified primary and secondary efficacy endpoints was pre-specified in the protocol to be conducted after accrual of the final number of COVID-19 cases (at least 164 cases). Subgroup analyses of VE were performed for the primary endpoints and secondary endpoint of severe COVID-19 cases. Additional post hoc analyses of subgroups defined by comorbidity risk assessment were performed. Secondary efficacy was analysed in the same manner as primary efficacy (Section 2.5.4.1.2.2), using the cases definitions for severe COVID-19 and CDC criteria for COVID-19 Statistical methods The estimands to evaluate the efficacy objectives were based on evaluable populations for efficacy. These estimands estimate the vaccine effect in the hypothetical setting where participants follow the study schedules and protocol requirements as directed. In addition, VE was also analysed by all- available efficacy population. The evaluable efficacy population included all eligible randomized participants who received all vaccination(s) as randomized, with Dose 2 received within the predefined window (19-42 days after Dose 1),and had no other important protocol deviations as determined by the clinician on or before 7 days after Dose 2. This was the primary analysis population for all efficacy analyses. Additional analyses based on the all-available efficacy populations, including all randomized participants who completed 1 and 2 vaccination doses respectively, were also performed. Assessment report EMA/707383/2020 Page 74/140 The two primary endpoints were tested hierarchically. Key secondary efficacy endpoints were evaluated sequentially in a prespecified order after the primary endpoints were met. Missing data were not imputed for the primary or secondary analyses. Sensitivity analysis of missing laboratory data was performed for the primary endpoint with MNAR assumption. VE was estimated as follows: 100 × (1 – IRR), where IRR is the calculated ratio of confirmed COVID- 19 illness per 1000 person-years follow-up in the active vaccine group to the corresponding illness rate in the placebo group from 7 days after the second dose. A Bayesian approach was used for the primary and secondary endpoints. A beta prior, beta (0.700102, 1), was used for θ = (1-VE)/(2-VE). The prior was centred at θ = 0.4118 (VE=30%). The 95% interval for θ is (0.005, 0.964) and the corresponding prior 95% interval for VE is (-26.2, 0.995). The Bayesian approach was not used for the point estimate for VE. At final analysis, efficacy was to be declared if the posterior probability of VE greater than or equal to 30% (“p”) > 98.60%. During Phase 2/3, 4 interim analyses (IAs) were planned to be performed by an unblinded statistical team after accrual of at least 32, 62, 92, and 120 cases. The final analysis was to be performed when 164 cases were observed. However, only one interim analysis was performed, at 94 cases. The final analysis was performed with 170 cases. At the time of the IAs, futility and VE with respect to the first primary endpoint were planned to be assessed. The IA that was performed was successful, as was the final analysis, and results were consistent with the IA. The success threshold for each interim analysis was to be calibrated to protect overall type I error at 2.5%. The risk of falsely concluding the VE to be above 30% (the type I error rate) with the proposed Bayesian model and over the interim analyses and final analysis under assumption of 30% vaccine efficacy is 0.021 (one sided). Hence the type I error rate for the primary endpoint is controlled. Although only one interim analysis was performed, the overall Type I error (overall probability of success when true VE=30%) was controlled at 0.025 with the originally proposed success/futility boundaries. Although Bayesian analysis are not usually accepted as confirmatory evidence in pivotal trials, the magnitude of the effect in this study, makes this concern redundant. Hence, the conclusions of the inference are considered robust.

Conduct of the study This study has gone through extensive changes or amendments. The amendments of the phase 1 of the study are deemed acceptable for a dose-finding design. Protocol amendments concerning the phase 3 of the study are overall adequately motivated and acceptable, since they are not expected to affect the conclusions on efficacy. Main Amendments have allowed to include adolescents from 12 to 15 years in the study and added corresponding objectives. Furthermore, secondary efficacy endpoints to include COVID-19 cases that occurred from 14 days after the second dose were added. The SAP was amended twice in line with protocol amendments. Baseline data Overall, demographic characteristics were well balanced between study groups.

Participants with pre-existing stable disease, defined as disease Assessment report EMA/707383/2020 Page 78/140 not requiring significant change in therapy or hospitalization for worsening disease during the 6 weeks before enrolment, were included as were participants with known stable infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) or hepatitis B virus (HBV). Numbers analysed The disposition of the efficacy populations is described in the Table below. There was an imbalance between the two study groups on the number of subjects excluded from the evaluable efficacy population. The two reasons responsible for this imbalance were “Dosing/administration error, subject did not receive correct dose of vaccine” (n=105 in vaccines and n=3 in placebo) and “IP administered that was deemed not suitable for use by Almac” (n=144 in vaccines and n=0 in placebo). There may be several explanations for this imbalance as listed below: • As the placebo was a fixed volume of saline, with no dilution required, the likelihood of a dosing error in the placebo group was lower compared to vaccine, which did required dilution. • An isolated dosing/administrative error event in one clinical centre affecting a higher number of participants receiving BNT162b2 (n=52 participants) has contributed to this imbalance. • Almac was responsible for determining suitability for use of investigational product that was subject to a temperature excursion. Due to the differences in the required storage conditions (ambient for the placebo versus ultracold for the BNT162b2), temperature excursions were not an issue for the placebo but were for BNT162b2. The protocol design was such that, if a participant experienced any of the specified trigger symptoms that could indicate COVID-19, a potential COVID-19 illness visit should occur, including obtaining a swab for the central laboratory.

Outcomes and estimation Primary Efficacy Endpoints – Final Analysis The result for the first primary efficacy analysis is shown in Table 5. VE against confirmed COVID-19 occurring at least 7 days after Dose 2 was 95.0%, with 8 COVID-19 cases in the BNT162b2 group compared to 162 COVID-19 cases in the placebo group. The vaccine efficacy of BNT162b2 for the same primary efficacy endpoint based on the Dose 2 all- available efficacy population was 95.2%, with 8 and 165 cases in the BNT162b2 and placebo group.

However the seropositive subjects were not many: among 38,000 subjects there were 407 individuals seropositive in the vaccine group and 436 in the placebo group in the age strata 16-55 YOA, and 150 individual seropositive in the vaccine group and 152 in the placebo group in the >55 YOA age strata. All Confirmed Cases of COVID-19 After Dose 1 An analysis of the cases occurring from dose 1 and until dose 2 or 1 week after dose 2 provides information on onset of protection. All reports of COVID-19 with onset at any time after Dose 1 are accounted for in Table 7, which provides a summary of cases for all participants in the Dose 1 all-available efficacy (modified intention- to-treat) population, regardless of evidence of infection before or during the vaccination regimen. Among these participants, 50 cases of COVID-19 occurred after Dose 1 in the BNT162b2 group compared to 275 cases in the placebo group (Table 7). Notably, in the BNT162b2 group, most cases occurred before Dose 2. Figure 9 displays cumulative incidence for the first COVID-19 occurrence after Dose 1 among all vaccinated participants based on Dose 1 all-available efficacy (modified intention-to-treat) population. Disease onset appears to track together for BNT162b2 and placebo until approximately 14 days after Dose 1, at which point the curves diverge, with cases steadily accumulating in the placebo group, while remaining virtually flat in the BNT162b2 group. From table 7 and figure 9 it is evident that the first dose offers partial protection, while few cases occur after the second dose.

These are the only immunogenicity results from a larger study population available at this stage, and further results from phase 3 are expected post approval. In addition, any data generated in attempts to establish a serological correlate of protection are expected to be reported when available. The results of the immunogenicity analyses here reported are generated from the Dose 2 evaluable immunogenicity population; baseline positive participants (by N-binding antibody or positive NAAT at Visit 1) were not excluded from these analyses. SARS-CoV-2 Neutralizing Titres and S1-Binding IgG Concentrations GMTs/GMCs At 1 month after Dose 2 (Day 52) of BNT162b2, there were substantial increases in SARS-CoV-2 50% neutralizing GMTs (Figure 10) and S1-binding IgG concentrations (GMCs) (Figure 11). GMTs/GMCs were higher in younger participants (18 to 55 years of age) than in older participants (56 to 85 years of age). Similar trends were observed for the SARS-CoV-2 90% neutralizing GMTs (data not shown in this report). Figure 10.

Geometric Mean Concentrations and 95% CI: S1-Binding IgG Level Assay – Phase 2 Dose 2 Evaluable Immunogenicity Population A few participants in the Dose 2 evaluable immunogenicity population had a positive baseline SARS- CoV-2 status. These SARS-CoV-2 status positive participants were analysed separately from the baseline negative participants. In general, at 1 month after Dose 2 among BNT162b2 recipients, SARS- CoV-2 50% neutralizing GMTs and S1-binding IgG GMCs in participants with a positive baseline SARS- CoV-2 status (n=3) were numerically higher than those observed in participants with a negative baseline SARS-CoV-2 status (n=163). Ancillary analyses Vaccine Efficacy by Subgroup For both primary endpoints, VE was also evaluated for subgroups of participants by age, sex race/ethnicity, and country, without evidence of prior infection (Table 8). Results for additional age groups are shown in Table 9. Post hoc analyses of efficacy by risk status were performed. For these analyses, at-risk participants were defined as those who had at least one Charlson Comorbidity Index condition or who were obese (defined as BMI ≥30 kg/m2) (table 11). Results for the all-available population were similar; no clinically meaningful differences were observed in VE on the basis of subgroup. These subgroup analyses are considered of importance. There is no evidence of significantly reduced efficacy in older age groups, i.e. >90% vaccine efficacy even in over 75-year-old subjects, although not statistically significant as there were only few cases in this age stratum. There were no cases in the 16-17-year-old age stratum, but efficacy is not anticipated to be lower in younger age groups compared to the overall study population. Additionally, it is reassuring that other factors, e.g. ethnicity/race, gender did not impact efficacy. Efficacy was not demonstrated in subjects who were Assessment report EMA/707383/2020 Page 85/140 seropositive at baseline, but the subgroup was very small and results are considered inconclusive rather than negative at this stage.

Vaccine efficacy for Severe COVID-19 cases, Final analysis Among participants without evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection before and during vaccination regimen, the estimated VE against severe COVID-19 occurring at least 7 days after Dose 2 was 66.4%, with 1 and 3 cases in the BNT162b2 and placebo groups respectively (Table 12). The posterior probability for the true vaccine efficacy greater than 30% is 74.29%, which did not meet the prespecified success criterion of >98.6% for this endpoint due to the small number of severe cases observed after Dose 2 in the study. Consequently, statistical testing of subsequent secondary endpoints (i.e., the additional secondary endpoints related to severe disease with pre-specified control of overall type 1 error) ended. However, descriptive summaries for the additional endpoints were provided.

Discussion on clinical efficacy Design and conduct of clinical studies The efficacy of the selected vaccine BNT162b2 was investigated in one pivotal trial, BNT162-02 study. This is a phase 1/2/3, multicentre, multinational, randomized, placebo-controlled, observer blind, dose finding, vaccine candidate efficacy and safety study in subjects that are healthy or have clinically stable comorbidities. Safety and immunogenicity data generated during the phase 1 portion of this study supported the selection of BNT162b2 at 30 μg, as a prime/boost regimen (separated by 21 days) as the vaccine candidate to proceed into Phase 2/3. Phase 2/3 was designed to evaluate the efficacy of BNT162b2, and to provide additional safety and immunogenicity data in a larger population. The study design for the pivotal phase 3 study is overall acceptable and in line with applicable guidelines. In the Phase 2/3 portion, approximately 44,000 participants were randomised equally and were to receive 2 doses of COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine or placebo separated by 21 days. The efficacy analyses included participants that received their second vaccination within 19 to 42 days after their first vaccination. Participants are planned to be followed for Assessment report EMA/707383/2020 Page 93/140 up to 24 months after Dose 2, for assessments of safety and efficacy against COVID-19. It is an observer-blind study, which is considered acceptable as placebo and vaccine differed in appearance. Randomisation and blinding were considered acceptable. Overall inclusion and exclusion criteria are acceptable and the study population is considered representative of the target population for vaccination, including subjects at higher risk of severe disease, i.e. age above 65 years (>20% with no upper age limit) and relevant underlying diseases (46%, e.g. obesity, chronic pulmonary diseases, diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease). Immunocompromised subjects and pregnant or breastfeeding women were excluded from the study . Subjects with known stable infection with HIV, HBV, HCV could be enrolled. Further, individuals who had previous clinical or microbiological diagnosis of COVID-19 were excluded , since the natural infection would affect the immunogenicity of the vaccine. The study mainly recruited in the USA, but other sites worldwide were also included. The primary endpoint (laboratory confirmed symptomatic COVID-19 in participants with no serological or virological evidence of past SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 7 days after receipt of the second dose, and then in all participants regardless of serostatus) is considered relevant for the purpose of establishing vaccine efficacy. SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA has been detected in nasal swab samples using Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS- CoV-2 PCR assay on the GeneXpert Molecular Diagnostic System. This method detects 2 structural genes of SARS-CoV-2: E and N2. A validation of this method was performed, and in addition the test was issued a EUA by FDA . In order to assess the analytical detection limit, live virus and commercial control (AccuPlexTM SARS-CoV-2) were used. Clinical sensitivity and specificity were evaluated in comparison with results obtained using another FDA authorised real-time RT-PCR method with positive or negative clinical specimens and pre-pandemic samples. Results showed that Cephe id Xpert Xpress PCR assay is a sensitive and specific method for the detection of SARS -CoV-2 RNA in nasal swabs. The positive rate of self-swab is similar to site-swab, 3.7% and 4.7% positive from self-swab and site-swab respectively in the BNT162b2 group. The third main secondary endpoint evaluated vaccine efficacy against severe cases of the disease (defined as confirmed COVID-19 with the presence of at least one of pre-defined severity criteria), to determine whether the vaccine decreased the incidence of confirmed severe COVID-19 in participants with no serological or virological evidence of past SARS-CoV-2 infection, 7 to 14 days after the second dose. Prevention of severe disease is an important endpoint, but the relative rarity of severe cases would require either a very large study population and/or a very long study duration to be certain to achieve sufficient statistical power. Therefore, it is acceptable as a secondary endpoint. The immunogenicity secondary and exploratory endpoints are considered acceptable. This is an event-driven study. This case-driven approach is deemed appropriate as the rate of accumulation of cases was not certain which could allow a rapid assessment of efficacy in case of a high attack rate. With assumptions of a true VE of 60% after the second dose of investigational product, a total of approximately 164 first confirmed COVID-19 illness cases will provide 90% power to conclude true VE >30% with high probability, allowing early stopping for efficacy at the IA. The randomisation procedure is considered appropriate to control confounding factors. The statistical methods are overall acceptable. The Bayesian approach used is not expected to affect the decisions from the hypothesis testing procedure. For consistency and ease of interpretation, the Clopper Pearson confidence intervals will be included in the SmPC rather than the Bayesian credible intervals. Of the four pre-planned interim analyses only one was performed, and the final analysis was also submitted. These analyses give highly consistent results with VE far from the null hypothesis limit Assessment report EMA/707383/2020 Page 94/140 of 30%. Confidence intervals were not adjusted for multiplicity, which is considered acceptable in this context. While it could be argued that alpha could be allocated according to a group sequential design, since no failed interim analysis has been performed, the alpha allocated to the interim analysis may be recycled to the final analysis. Hence the final analysis could have been performed at full alpha level and the coverage probability of the “naïve” confidence interval is therefor considered correct. The interim and final analyses are conducted in an evaluable efficacy population of participants who receive the two doses within the predefined window and excluding subjects with other major protocol deviation, in order to obtain a best-case estimate of vaccine efficacy. However, this approach could result in bias due to exclusion of subjects. For this reason, sensitivity analyses assessing VE based on all laboratory-confirmed cases with symptom onset at any time after the first dose (dose 1 all-available efficacy population) and 7 days after the second dose (dose 2 all-available efficacy population) have been performed without excluding participants with major protocol deviations. Overall, the study report including the final analysis is considered adequate. This is not the final report for the study, as the study is expected to continue for a total of 24 months. Baseline data At the cut-off date of 14 November 2020, the disposition of the 38,000 participants were similar in the BNT162b2 and placebo groups. Overall, 0.2% of participants did not receive study vaccine. A small percentage of participants discontinued study vaccine after Dose 1 and before Dose 2 (0.6%). The reasons for discontinuation were also balanced. The most frequently reported reasons for discontinuation included: no longer meets eligibility criteria (0.3% BNT162b2; 0.4% placebo; the most common reason was previous clinical or microbiological diagnosis of COVID-19), withdrawal by participant, and AEs (0.1% in both treatment groups). The distribution of demographics and other baseline characteristics was similar between both arms among participants without evidence of infection up to 7 days after dose 2 in the final analysis evaluable efficacy population. Overall, most participants were White (8 2.8%) and non -Hispanic/non-Latino (72.7%) (26.8% of Hispanic/latino ethnicity), median age was 52.0 years, and approximately 49% were female. There were 42.6% of participants in the older age group (>50 years), 26% of participants over 65 years of age and 0.7% (112 subjects) of participants adolescents (12-17 years). In 75-85 years and >85 years age groups, 837 and 5 participants respectively had been vaccinated with BNT162b2 (Dose 2 all-available efficacy). Across both treatment groups, 20.5% had any comorbidity (per the Charlson comorbidity index). The most frequently reported comorbidities were diabetes (with and w ithout chronic complications, 8.4%) and pulmonary disease (7.8%) and were reported at similar frequencies in each group. Obese participants made up 35.1% of the safety population. Overall, 120 subjects were HIV-positive and were evenly distributed between treatment groups. Efficacy data and additional analyses The population for the analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint included 36,621 participants 12 years of age and older (18,242 in the Vaccine group and 18,379 in the placebo group) who did not have evidence of prior infection with SARS-CoV-2 through 7 days after the second dose. The first interim analysis for vaccine efficacy (VE) was conducted on 08-Nov-2020 by an IDMC. The data cut-off date was 04-Nov-2020, when a total of 94 confirmed COVID-19 cases were accrued. There were 4 COVID-19 cases in the BNT162b2 group compared to 90 COVID-19 cases reported in the Assessment report EMA/707383/2020 Page 95/140 placebo group. These data gave a vaccine efficacy of 95.5% (95%CI: 88.8%, 97.5%) among participants without evidence of infection up to 7 days after Dose 2, and a >99.99% posterior probability for the true vaccine efficacy greater than 30% conditioning on available data. Participants included in the first interim analysis were also included in the final analysis. The date for data cut-off for the final efficacy analysis was November 14, 2020, when a total of 170 confirmed COVID-19 cases were accrued. The protective efficacy in subjects without prior evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection from 7 days after dose 2 was high, 95.0% (95% CI: 90.0; 97.9) in the primary efficacy population (8 cases and 162 cases in the BNT162b2 and placebo groups, respectively). The posterior probability of >99.99% for the true VE greater than 30% met the pre-specified success criterion of >98.6% for this endpoint. Among participants without evidence of SARS -CoV-2 infection before and during vaccination regimen, VE against confirmed COVID -19 occurring at least 14 days after dose 2 was 94.2%, 95%CI (88.7%, 97.2%) (8 and 139 cases in the BNT162b2 and placebo groups respectively) with a posterior probability (VE≥30%/data) of >99.99%. Slightly more subjects in the placebo group had symptoms of COVID-19 without being a confirmed case by PCR. This is also reflected in slightly more subjects in the placebo arm with result not available from the swab. Sensitivity analysis of missing laboratory data was performed for the primary endpoint with the available data, assuming a higher than the observed case rate when imputing missing efficacy endpoints from participants in the BNT162b2 group only, to reflect potentially unknowable missing not at random (MNAR) effects that are unfavourable for efficacy results of the study. 500 imputations were performed that were generated using SAS PROC MI Fully Conditional Specification (FCS) method. Each imputation filled in the missing laboratory results based on a logistic regression model at the subject level. VE after imputation was over 80% also with up to 15-fold increase of positivity rate applied to the BNT162b2 group. Hence, there is no concern that this slight imbalance has introduced any significant bias to the results presented below. The 2-dose schedule is considered justified both based on immune responses and on the actual efficacy results. In dose 1 all-available efficacy (mITT) population, regardless of evidence of infection before or during the vaccination regimen, 50 cases of COVID-19 occurred after Dose 1 in the BNT162b2 group (n=21,314 subjects) compared to 275 cases in the placebo group (n=21,258 subjects). Notably, in the BNT162b2 group, most cases (36/(50)) occurred before Dose 2. The estimated VE against confirmed COVID-19 occurring after dose 1 was 82% (2-sided 95% CI: 75.6 %, 86.9%), with an estimated VE of 52.4% (2-sided 95% CI: 29.5%, 68.4%) against confirmed COVID- 19 occurring after dose 1 but before dose 2. The cumulative incidence curves for the first COVID-19 occurrence after dose 1 (all-available efficacy population) showed that COVID-19 disease onset seems to occur similarly for both BNT162b2 and placebo groups until approximately 14 days after Dose 1, then cumulative curves diverge with more cases accumulating in the placebo group than in the BNT162b2 group. During the follow-up time of approximately 2 months post-dose 2, the BNT162b2 cumulative curve is stable which would not suggest waning protection. A longer follow-up is necessary to investigate the duration of the efficacy of the vaccine in protecting against the disease. For both primary endpoints, no clinically meaningful differences in VE by subgroup were observed by age group, country, ethnicity, sex, or race in the dose 2 evaluable efficacy population, with VE estimates that ranged from 91.2% to 100.0%. Efficacy was consistent across relevant subgroups. The results in elderly are of great importance, as increasing age is an identified risk factor for severe disease and death. The results from this study are therefore reassuring suggesting a high protective efficacy in subjects ≥65 years of age (95%, 95% CI: 66.8; 99.9). There was no indication of Assessment report EMA/707383/2020 Page 96/140 decreasing efficacy in subjects ≥75 years although the number of cases was small (0 in the vaccine group and 5 in placebo). In addition, the number of subjects >85YOA is very limited (5 subjects) hence the impact of immunosenescence on vaccine efficacy in these very old individuals remain uncertain. Among participants without prior evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection before and during vaccination regimen, VE for participants at risk of severe COVID-19 including those with 1 or more comorbidities that increase the risk of severe COVID-19 (e.g. asthma, obese with body mass index (BMI) ≥30 kg/m2, chronic pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension) was 95.3%, as compared with 94.7% for those not at risk. VE for participants ≥65 years of age and at risk was 91.7%, as compared with 100% for those ≥65 years of age and not at risk. VE was similar in obese (95.4%) and non-obese (94.8%) participants. The VE by comorbidity status are as follows: cardiovascular (VE 100.0 (-0.8, 100.0)), Chronic pulmonary disease (93.0 (54.1, 99.8)), diabetes (94.7 (66.8, 99.9)), Hypertension (95.4 (82.6, 99.5)). Severe disease cases were uncommon in the study: 1 case in the vaccine group and 4 cases in the placebo group (one case in the all evaluable population) after 7 days post second vaccination. None of the severe cases were baseline positive for SARS-CoV-2. In the evaluable efficacy population, subjects without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, the estimated VE against severe COVID-19 occurring at least 7 days after dose 2 was 66.4% (95% CI: - 124.8%: 96.3%). The posterior probability for the true VE greater than 30% is 74.29% (7 days) and 74.32% (14 days), which did not meet the pre-specified success criterion for this endpoint, therefore no reliable conclusion can be drawn at this stage. While data on severe COVID-19 are limited, the experience with other vaccines (rotavirus and influenza vaccines with known efficacy against mild disease but better efficacy against severe disease) coupled with the high observed vaccine efficacy observed for BNT162b2 on all COVID-19 cases in populations with any comorbidity gives reassurance that the vaccine is likely to prevent severe disease. However, a precise estimate of its protective effect is presently lacking. The final study report may include additional data to the extent that the study is continued in a randomised fashion with a placebo group. The second primary endpoint -VE in participants with and without prior evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection- yielded similar results as the one in the population excluding those without evidence of prior infection. However, analysis is largely driven by events in subjects without evidence of prior infection, and therefore does not provide additional information. It is not possible to conclude on vaccine efficacy in subjects with prior COVID-19, or signs of infection with SARS-CoV2 because only a small number of subjects were found to be seropositive at baseline (approximately 550 in each vaccine and placebo group), and only 2 cases of disease were reported in this subset (1 in each group). Further data may become available as the trial proceeds, but it is unlikely that the study will be able to deliver conclusive evidence for a number of reasons (e.g. it is very likely that the number of subjects seropositive will remain limited, and that there will be a lower incidence of disease in seropositive placebo recipients compared to seronegative placebo recipients due to existing partial protection). The extent of additional protection in seropositive subjects is presently uncertain. Effectiveness studies may give us some information on this regard. Genome sequencing of the SARS -CoV-2 strains in the BNT162b2 vaccine and placebo groups has not been performed. However, this work is planned by the Applicant. The primary analysis of efficacy was conducted when the pre-defined number of 164 COVID-19 cases had occurred. This correspond to about 1.5 months of median follow-up time duration after completion of the full vaccination regimen. Therefore, available efficacy data are limited in term of follow-up duration, and the efficacy of the vaccine over longer-time remains unknown. Data are expected to become available post-authorisation. Assessment report EMA/707383/2020 Page 97/140 Immune responses in terms of neutralising antibodies were measured in the phase 1 and 2 part of the study. Overall, the immune responses measured in the phase 1 and 2 part of the pivotal study are consistent and in line with the phase 1 study BNT162-01 results. As expected, both neutralising antibody levels and S-protein binding antibody levels were higher in the youngest age stratum compared to the older age stratum. Serum titres in vaccinated subjects were numerically higher compared to human convalescent sera, up to 1 month after dose 2. There is presently no established correlate of protection. Very limited results by baseline serostatus were provided, but updated immunogenicity data is expected to become available. Cell mediated immune responses were demonstrated in the phase 1 part of the study as well as in the other phase 1/2 study BNT162-01, but in a small cohort of subjects only. A clear Th1-polarised response, i.e. IFNγ/IL-2 ICS and limited IL-4 ICS was shown, which is reassuring in terms of lack of VAED. In total 14 adolescents aged 12-15 years were included in the vaccine group and 13 in the placebo group, and 52 adolescents aged 16-17 years in the vaccine and 55 in the placebo group. Vaccine efficacy could not be estimated for these subjects as no cases of disease were reported. No immune response data are available. However extrapolation of efficacy is possible from young adults because, from an immune system perspective, adolescents do not differ from young adults, thus there are no reasons to believe that the vaccine will not be as efficacious at least in the age subgroup proposed for the current indication (>16 years). At cut-off date (14-Nov-2020), 120 subjects HIV positive were vaccinated with BNT162b2. Immunogenicity and efficacy data are not available at this time but will be provided post-authorisation. Additional efficacy data needed in the context of a conditional MA The final clinical study report for study C4591001 will be submitted no later than December 2023 and is subject to a specific obligation laid down in the MA. 2.5.4. Conclusions on clinical efficacy Excellent vaccine efficacy (preventing symptomatic COVID-19) was shown in subjects without evidence of prior SARS-Cov2 infection (VE 95.0% (95% CI: 90.3%, 97.6%), which was consistent across relevant subgroups. It is likely that the vaccine also protects against severe COVID-19, though these events were rare in the study, and statistically certain conclusion cannot be drawn. It is presently not known if the vaccine protects against asymptomatic infection, or its impact on viral transmission. The duration of protection is not known. The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the missing efficacy data in the context of a conditional MA: • The final clinical study report will be submitted no later than December 2023 and is subject to a specific obligation laid down in the MA. This will provide long-term data. Regarding missing data to confirm efficacy in subpopulations that were not studied or whose data are limited please refer to sections 2.7 and 3.3. Assessment report EMA/707383/2020 Page 98/140 2.6. Clinical safety The candidate vaccine BNT162b2 at 30 µg given twice 21 days apart was assessed a first-in-human (FIH) study in April 2020 in Germany (BNT162-01) and a Phase 1/2/3 study (C4591001) was initiated shortly afterwards in the United States (US). Hence, the safety data base for BNT162b2 constitutes of two Phase 1 studies (BNT162-01 and C4591001) and one Phase 2/3 study still ongoing (C4591001). The cut-off for safety data included in this assessment is 14 November 2020. The two Phase 1 trials (BNT162-01 and C4591001) are described in previous sections. Study C4591001 was initially started as a Phase 1/2 study in the USA and was then amended to expand to a global Phase 3 study. Phase 2/3 of Study C4591001 included subjects that were stratified into two age groups: 18-55 years and >55-85 years. The Phase 3 part however was subsequently amended (6 Sept 2020 protocol amendment) to include subjects from 16 years of age in the younger age group (and then from 12 years of age) and subjects >85 years of age in the older age group. AEs were collected during the Phase 2/3 study from the signing of the informed consensus document through and including 1 month after Dose 2 (visit no. 3). In addition, in all follow-up visits where blood samples for immunogenicity data are taken, any AEs and SAEs as appropriate occurring up to 48 hours were recorded after each visit. Immunogenicity follow-up is planned to occur during that period with visits 1-month, 6-months, 12-months and 24-months post the first vaccination. AEs are categorized by frequency, maximum severity, seriousness, and relationship to study intervention using SOC and PT according to MedDRA. SAEs are recorded for up to 6 months after Dose 2 (ongoing at the time of this submission). In addition, any potential COVID-19 illness will lead to extra visits followed by convalescent visits. At the cut-off date 14-Nov-20, the longest follow-up time available was 12-13 weeks after Dose 2 (N=780: N=382 BNT162b2 and N=398 placebo). Overall the study enrolled Phase 2/3 participants (N=43,448) that received at least one dose of BNT162b2 (N=21,720) or placebo (N=21,728), regardless of duration of follow-up. The assessment is based on the following safety data (cut-off date 14 Nov 2020): • Phase 1: i) Study C4591001 (N=72 any dose of BNT162b2; N=12 BNT162b2 30µg; placebo N=18); ii) Study BNT162-01 (N=60 any dose of BNT162b2; N=12 BNT162b2 30µg; placebo N=0). • Phase 2/3 participants with a follow-up ≥ 2 months after Dose 2 (N=19,037) of either BNT162b2 (N=9531) or placebo (N=9536). This subset constitutes the core safety data set in this assessment. • All enrolled Phase 2/3 participants (N=43,448) that received at least one dose of BNT162b2 (N=21,720) or placebo (N=21,728), regardless of duration of follow-up. In this population, the total number of subjects 16-17 years were 283 (N=138 BNT162b; N=145 placebo) and 100 participants were 12 to 15 years of age (N=100; 49 in the BNT162b2 group and 51 in the placebo group). HIV-positive subjects (BNT162b2 N=99, placebo N=97) were included in this summary but not included in the analyses of the overall study objectives. • Phase 2/3 participants (N=37,706) randomised before 9 October 2020 who received BNT162b2 (N=18,860) or placebo (N=18,846). These subjects had a median follow-up time of 2 months after Dose 2 (at least 1 month after dose 2). Among these, 1,148 subjects had a positive SARS-CoV-2 baseline status (vaccinated N=558; placebo N=590). Assessment report EMA/707383/2020 Page 99/140 • Reactogenicity was evaluated based on a subset of subjects in the Phase 2/3 study, i.e. 8,183 (N=4,093 BNT162b2; N=4,090 placebo), who reported on local reactions, systemic events, and antipyretic/pain medication usage for 7 days after each dose by using an e-diary. Eight subjects aged 16-17 years were included in this subset (BNT162b2 N=5; placebo N=3). 2.6.1. Patient exposure Distribution and Exposure were presented for the population with median follow up of 2 months and for the whole population. Of the 37,796 subjects in the group with median follow up of 2 months who were randomized in the study before 9 October 2020, 90 participants (0.2%) were excluded from the safety population (89 did not receive study intervention and 1 did not provide informed consent). BNT162b2 N = 18904 Placebo N = 18892 N (%) N (%) Median follow up 2 months (at least one month after dose 2) Randomized 18904 (100%) 18892 (100%) Vaccinated with Dose 1 18858 (99.8%) 18849 (99.8%) Vaccinated with Dose 2 18553 (98.1) 18534 (98.1%) HIV positive 59 61 Follow up ≥ 2months after dose 2 9531 (50.5%) 9536 (50.6%) Follow up ≥ 10 to < 12 weeks after dose 2 2853 (15.1%) 2809 (14.9%) Follow up ≥ 12 to < 14 weeks after dose 2 382 (2.0%) 398 (2.1%) For Dose 1, three participants randomized to the placebo group received BNT162b2, and two participants randomized to the BNT162b2 group received placebo. For Dose 2, four participants randomized to the placebo group received BNT162b2, and five participants randomized to the BNT162b2 group received placebo. The majority of participants received Dose 2 between 19 to 23 days after Dose 1 in the BNT162b2 (93.1%) and placebo (92.9%) groups. Overall, 0.3% of participants were HIV-positive and were evenly distributed between treatment groups. Note that HIV-positive participants were included in the safety population and are shown as part of the study demographics and disposition but did not have safety data available to contribute to the safety analyses at the time of the data cut-off. In total 1145 individuals of the safety population were SARS-CoV-2 seropositive at baseline. A high exposure rate of 99.8% to the first dose was reached in both vaccine and control arm and a small number of individuals were withdrawn after the first dose, leading to a high rate of exposure to the second dose in both study arms (98.2% and 98.1%). Reasons for withdrawals (1.0% and 1.4%, respectively) were in most cases withdrawals by the participant, or loss to follow-up. There were no clinically meaningful differences in the safety population by age group, baseline SARS- CoV-2 status, ethnicity, race, or sex. Assessment report EMA/707383/2020 Page 100/140 Table 14 Safety Population, by Baseline SARS-CoV-2 Status - ~38000 Subjects for Phase 2/3 Analysis The disposition, exposure and withdrawal profile of the whole study population was comparable to the group that was randomised before 9 October 2020 with median follow up of 2 months. Among the 37,706 subjects with a median follow-up of 2 months, 50.6% had ≥2 months duration of follow-up after Dose 2 and 91.6% had a duration of follow-up time of ≥1 month after Dose 2. Around 3000 individuals have already a follow of at least 10 weeks after dose 2. Updates, including additional safety data as well as assessment of the differences in safety profile in the longer follow-up compared to the initial safety dataset, if any, shall be provided when more mature data will be available. Six-months post Dose 2 follow-up data from the first ~6000 subjects are expected by the end of February 2021 and this will allow a relevant discussion on the safety profile versus the initial dataset. Based on the population with a median follow up of 2 months, demographic characteristics are considered well balanced between vaccine and placebo arm. Most included subjects were white (83%), with a median age of 52 years. A balanced distribution is seen regarding gender (51% male, 49% Assessment report EMA/707383/2020 Page 101/140 female). The younger and older age groups were 57.8% and 42.2% of participants, respectively. Within each age group, most demographic characteristics were similar in the BNT162b2 and placebo groups. Of note, 35% of individuals were obese in both study arms. Across both treatment groups, 20.7% had any comorbidity. The number of subjects with any Charlson co-morbidity diagnoses was balanced in both study arms (20%). Most prevalent were the diagnoses diabetes mellitus (7.8%) and COPD (7.8%) followed by subjects showing any type of malignant disease (3.9% in vaccine and 3.5% in placebo group). Other diagnoses were abundant with ≤ 1% in both study arms (population with a median follow up of 2 months). In the population with a follow-up ≥2 months, Charlson co-morbidity diagnoses was similar. The demographic distribution was somewhat different when comparing seropositive and seronegative individuals, observing a median age of 43 years in seropositive and of 52 years in seronegative individuals. Furthermore, the seropositive group covered a higher proportion of obese individuals (42.2% versus 34.7%). Demographic characteristics in the whole population were comparable to those seen in the population with a median follow up time of 2 months. 2.6.2. Reactogenicity Reactogenicity was evaluated in a subset of the Phase 2/3 study of 8,183 subjects (BNT162b2 n=4093; placebo n=4090) from both age groups (16 to 55 and >55 years of age) that received BNT162b2 or vaccine according to the proposed dosing regimen. Of note, the number of subjects aged 16-17 years included in this subset was limited (n=8; BNT162b2 n=5; placebo n=3). After each dose, the subjects reported any local reactions, systemic events, including antipyretic/pain medication usage for 7 days, by using an e-diary (cut-off date 14 Nov 20). Local reactions The most commonly reported local reaction among the subject that received BNT162b2 was pain at the injection site, which occurred slightly more common among subjects 16-55 years (N=2291 [83.1%] post Dose 1; N=2098 [77.8%] post Dose 2) compared to those >55 years of age (N=1802 [71.1%] post Dose 1; N=1660 [66.1%] post Dose 2). In the placebo group, pain at the injection site after Doses 1 and 2 was reported at a lower frequency (16-55 [14.0% and 11.7%]; >55 [9.3% vs 7.7%]). There was no difference in frequency of redness and swelling at injection site after the two doses of BNT162b2. Redness occurred in about 5-7% in both age groups (16-55 [4.5% after Dose 1, 5.9% after Dose 2]; >55 [4.7% after Dose 1, 7.2% after Dose 2]). Swelling was reported also in about 5-7% of the subjects in both age groups (16-55 [5.8% after Dose 1, 6.3% after Dose 2]; >55 [6.5% after Dose 1, 7.5% after Dose 2]). In the placebo group, redness and swelling were reported infrequently in both age groups (≤1.2%). Overall, the majority of local reactions were mild or moderate in severity, no Grade 4 reactions were reported. Severe local reactions (≤0.7%) were reported infrequently in the BNT162b2 group after either dose and was more commonly reported in the younger group. Across age groups, local reactions for the BNT162b2 group after either dose had a median onset between 1-3 days (Day 1 was the day of vaccination), with a median duration of 1-2 days. No clinically meaningful differences in local reactions were observed by baseline SARS-CoV-2 status subgroups. However, since the baseline SARS-CoV-2 positive subgroup included very few participants (vaccinated n=154; placebo n=164), these results should be interpreted with caution. Assessment report EMA/707383/2020 Page 102/140 Systemic reactions Table 15 Subjects Reporting Systemic Events, by Maximum Severity, Within 7 Days After Each Dose, Age Group 16-55 Years – Reactogenicity Subset for Phase 2/3 Analysis– Safety Population Table 16 Subjects Reporting Systemic Events, by Maximum Severity, Within 7 Days After Each Dose, Age Group >55 Years – Reactogenicity Subset for Phase 2/3 Analysis–Safety Population Assessment report EMA/707383/2020 Page 103/140 Systemic events were generally reported more frequently in the BNT162b2 group than in the placebo group, for both age groups and doses. Across age groups, median onset day for all systemic events after either dose of BNT162b2 was 2-3 days, with a median duration of 1 day. Systemic events were generally increased in frequency and severity in the younger age group compared with the older age group, with frequencies and severity increasing with number of doses (Dose 1 vs Dose 2). Vomiting and diarrhoea were exceptions, with vomiting reported similarly infrequently in both age groups and diarrhoea reported at similar incidences after each dose. Systemic events in the younger group compared with the older group, with frequencies increasing with number of doses (Dose 1 vs Dose 2), were: fatigue, headache, muscle pain, chills, joint pain and, fever. Following both Dose 1 and Dose 2, use of antipyretic/pain medication was slightly less frequent in the older age group (19.9% vs 37.7%) than in the younger age group (27.8% vs 45.0%). Of note, medication use increased in both age groups after Dose 2 as compared with after Dose 1. Use of antipyretic/pain medication was less frequent in the placebo group than in the BNT162b2 group and was similar after Dose 1 and Dose 2 in the younger and older placebo groups (ranging from 9.8% to 22.0%). No clinically meaningful differences in systemic reactions were observed by baseline SARS-CoV-2 status subgroups, however as mentioned data in baseline SARS-CoV-2 positive subjects are limited. Overall, the reported reactogenicity is in line with what can be expected from any vaccine. The local and systemic reactions were transient and of short duration, the majority were mild to moderate at intensity and the reactions were milder among older subjects (>55 years). 2.6.3. Adverse events In the subset of participants randomised before 9 October 2020 with Median 2 Months of Follow-Up After Dose 2 (N= 37,586; from Dose 1 to 1 month after dose 2) and the subset of participants with at least 2 Months of Follow -Up After Dose 2 (N=19,067; from dose 1 to data cut off 14 November 2020 ), the numbers of overall participants who reported at least 1 AE and at least 1 related AE were higher in the BNT162b2 group as compared with the placebo group. This trend continued to be seen through the data cut-off date for all enrolled participants (N=43,252; from dose 1 to data cut -off 14 November 2020 ). Overall, AEs reported from Dose 1 to 7 days after Dose 1 and from Dose 2 to 7 days after Dose 2 were largely attributable to reactogenicity events (see above). This observation provides a reasonable explanation for the greater rates of AEs observed overall in the BNT162b2 group (26.7%) compared with the placebo group (12.2%). Among all 43,448 enrolled participants included in the safety database up to the data cut- off date, few participants in the BNT162b2 group (0.2%) and in the placebo group (0.1%) were withdrawn because of AEs. Assessment report EMA/707383/2020 Page 104/140 Table 17 Number (%) of Subjects Reporting at Least 1 Adverse Event from Dose 1 to date cutoff date (14 Nov 2020) – Subjects with 2 months follow-up time after dose 2 for Phase 2/3 Analysis – Safety Population Overall, in participants with 2 months follow up after dose 2, 21.4% / 12.6% (vaccine/placebo) and 13.6%/3.6% experienced at least 1 AE and 1 related AE, respectively. It is noted that the frequency of AEs and related AEs is lower compared to individuals with a median follow up of 2 months (27%/12.5% and 20.8%/5.1%). The frequency of individuals experiencing AEs were slightly higher in the younger compared to older individuals (29.3% and 23.8% vaccine arm; 13.2% and 11.7% placebo arm). SAEs and deaths were however balanced in both study arms in both age groups. The frequency of immediate AEs after dose 1 was low in participants with median 2 months of follow- up after Dose 2 (0.4%) and the whole population (≤0.5%), belonging mostly to the SOC general disorders and administration site conditions, primarily injection site reactions. No participant reported an immediate allergic reaction to vaccine. Assessment report EMA/707383/2020 Page 105/140 Severe AEs, SAEs, AEs leading to discontinuation, and deaths were reported by ≤1.1%, 0.6%, 0.0%, and 0.0%, i.e. low and equally distributed in both study arms. No differences vs. the whole population were seen according to age groups. The rate of AEs and related AEs was slightly higher in the SARS-CoV-2 negative group compared to SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals. Stratification according to serostatus in the safety group median follow up 2 months reveals overall very low numbers of severe AEs, SAEs and deaths. Table 18 Number (%) of Subjects Reporting at Least 1 Adverse Event from Dose 1 to 1 Month after Dose 2, by Baseline SARS-CoV-2 Status - ~38000 Subject for Phase 2/3 Analysis – Safety Population Baseline SARS-CoV-2 Status: Positive Assessment report EMA/707383/2020 Page 106/140 Table 19 Number (%) of Subjects Reporting at Least 1 Adverse Event From Dose 1 to 1 Month After Dose 2, by Baseline SARS-CoV-2 Status - ~38000 Subjects for Phase 2/3 Analysis – Safety Population Baseline SARS-CoV-2 Status: Negative There were 19,067 participants with at least 2 months follow-up time after Dose 2, and similar to the 37,586 participants randomised before 9 October 2020 with a median of 2 months of safety follow up after Dose 2, most AEs reported after Dose 1 up to the safety data cut-off date were reactogenicity, in SOCs of: • general disorders and administration site conditions (11.9% BNT162b2 vs 2.9% placebo) • musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (5.5% BNT162b2 vs 2.1% placebo) • nervous system disorders (4.2% BNT162b2 vs 2.1% placebo) • infections and infestations (1.9% BNT162b2 vs 1.6% placebo) • gastrointestinal disorders (2.6% BNT162b2 vs 1.8% placebo). In the younger versus older BNT162b2 age groups, AE SOCs were: • general disorders and administration site conditions (13.1% vs 10.4%) • musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (6.0% vs 4.9%) Assessment report EMA/707383/2020 Page 107/140 • nervous system disorders (4.8% vs 3.5%) • infections and infestations (1.9% vs 1.9%) • gastrointestinal disorders (2.7% vs 2.5%) Most often occurring events by PT comprised vaccine typical reactions such as injection site pain, fever, fatigue as well as myalgia and arthralgia. Lymphadenopathy occurred in 0.4% in the ≥ 2 months follow up subset (0% in placebo arm), or 0.3% of cases in the whole population (0% in placebo arm). Nausea also occurred in 0.6% more cases in the vaccine compared to placebo arm. Related AEs belonged overall to the same SOCs as described above, i.e. general disorders and administration site conditions (3426 cases, 20.8%), musculoskeletal reactions (1148 cases, 6.1%), and nervous system disorders (979 cases, 5.2%) and occurred overall more often in the vaccine than in the placebo arm (median follow up 2 months). Severe AEs occurred more often in the vaccine arm (1.2% vs. 0.6%) in the subset with a median follow up time of 2 months, reflecting a similar SOC pattern. The following specific observations are made based on PTs: Numerical disbalances are observed for several hypersensitivity terms ((drug)hypersensitivity/ immunisation events; 5/3 cases ≥ 2 months group, 13/6 cases whole population, 6/1 cases deemed related in the whole population, 4 cases deemed severe (whole population), in the SOC immune system disorders). Subjects were excluded from the Phase 2/3 study if they had a history of severe adverse reaction associated with a vaccine or to any component of the BNT162b2 vaccine. The protocol did not exclude individuals with non-severe allergic reactions to other vaccines or individuals with an allergic reaction, of any severity, to medication, food or environmental allergies. In the Phase 2/3 study, 11,673 subjects had a medical history of allergic condition (n=5839 BNT162b2; n=5834 placebo), and, among those, two cases of allergic AEs (1 in each treatment group) occurred, which were deemed related to study treatment by the investigator. The participant who received BNT162b2 had a history of allergy to tree pollen. This participant reported Drug hypersensitivity and Urticaria on the day of Dose 1. Both AEs were of moderate severity and lasted one day. The participant did not receive Dose 2 of the vaccine. The participant who received placebo had an allergy to shellfish and iodine. This participant reported Allergy to vaccine and Pharyngeal swelling 1 day after Dose 1. Both events were of moderate severity and lasted 13 days and 10 days, respectively. This participant did not receive Dose 2 of study intervention. In the ~38,000 study participants with a median of 2 months of safety follow-up after Dose 2, none reported an immediate AE (occurring within 30 minutes after dosing) that was indicative of an allergic reaction to vaccine. Four cases of facial paralysis were observed in the vaccine arm (facial paralysis [n=4 BNT162b2; n=0 placebo] facial paresis [n=0 BNT162b2; n=1 placebo] in total 4/1 whole population). Time to onset after injection with BNT162b2 was 3, 9 and 48 days after Dose 2 and 37 days after Dose 1, which suggest a possible association with the vaccination. The two subjects with a time to onset of 3 and 9 nine days had no previous history of Bell´s palsy, both subjects improved with prednisolone and the events were also deemed related to study intervention by the study physician. Numerical imbalances in AEs for appendicitis and biliary events are observed (8/4 and 14/5 cases (whole population)). However, none of the cases considered related to study drug treatment. Assessment report EMA/707383/2020 Page 108/140 Cases of (osteo/peri) arthritis (15/15, vaccine/placebo) and psoriasis (1/1, vaccine/placebo) have been observed in the vaccine arm, which where however balanced in frequency between vaccine and placebo arm. An imbalance in PT connected to sleep disturbances was noted in the whole population, which was driven by 25 more cases of insomnia-related events (insomnia/sleep disorder/abnormal dreams in the BNT162b2 group versus the placebo arm). A slight imbalance of hyperhidrosis/night sweats was noted in the whole population (n=26/15 BNT162b2 group versus 8/3 in the placebo arm). Hyperhidrosis as a medical term indicates a condition that differs from the sweating associated with episodes of fever. The numerical relation here is not supported by biological plausibility. Injection site pruritus was reported in 31 subjects in the BNT162b2 group compared to 6 subjects in the placebo arm (whole population). Pain in the extremity was reported in 183 subjects in the BNT162b2 group and in 34 subjects in the placebo group (whole population). Stratification according to age did not reveal meaningful differences in the types of AEs. A stratification according to serostatus was performed in individuals with a follow up of at least one month (median FUP 2 months) and ≥2 months. Most abundant SOCs are similar to the SOCs identified in the general population with ≥2 months follow-up. No additional safety concerns are detected when stratifying according to serostatus. 2.6.4. Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events SAEs This section presents the SAEs reported up to the data cut-off (14-nov-20). Among the 19,067 subjects (BNT162b2 n=9531; placebo n= 9536) with ≥2 months of follow-up post Dose 2, small percentages of subjects in the 30 µg BNT162b2 group (56 [0.6%]) and the placebo group (53 [0.6%]) reported any SAEs. Subjects in both the BNT162b2 group and placebo group, respectively, reported SAEs at similar rates for the observed SOCs. A similar frequency was observed for the entire study population and no clinically meaningful differences in SAEs were observed by age, baseline SARS-CoV-2 status, ethnicity, race or sex subgroups. Among all included subjects (BNT162b2 n=21720; placebo n=21728) three SAEs were reported in the SOC immune system disorders. One SAE of anaphylactic reaction (related to bee sting) and one drug hypersensitivity (related to treatment with doxycycline) was reported in the BNT162b2 group. In addition, one SAE of anaphylactic shock (related to an ant bite) was reported in the placebo group. In the subset of individuals aged 16-17 years old, one SAE (facial bone fracture) was reported. After the cut-off date and up to 5-Dec-20, additional 22 SAEs have been reported (blinded data). SAEs related to study intervention Up to the cut-off date, four of the SAEs in the BNT162b2 group and none in the placebo group were assessed by the investigator as related to study intervention. One event of lymphadenopathy and one event of shoulder injury due to incorrected administration were considered related to BNT162b2. It is not agreed that the event of ventricular arrythmia and the event of pain in the lower back/extremities/and radicular paraesthesia have been convincingly demonstrated to be related to Assessment report EMA/707383/2020 Page 109/140 study intervention, since the subjects had underlying conditions that could have caused the two SAEs, there is little biological plausibility, and the overall numbers of reported events do not allow for a causal inference. Death Six events of death (2 in the BNT162b2 group and 4 in the placebo group) were reported in the Phase 2/3 study up to the cut-off date of 14-Nov-20. None of the deaths were considered related to study intervention, which is agreed since other pre-existing diseases were more likely to have caused death than the vaccine. After the cut-off date and up to 5-Dec-20, one additional event of death due to aortic rupture were reported (data blinded). 2.6.5. Laboratory findings Laboratory results are available for the two Phase 1 studies, but not for the Phase 2/3 trials. This is considered acceptable. Except for minor transient decrease in lymphocyte count observed for some of the subjects, no abnormal lab results were reported from the Phase 1 studies. 2.6.6. Safety in special populations No clinically meaningful differences in AEs were observed by age, country (mostly Argentina, Brazil, USA), ethnicity (Hispanic/Latino, Non-Hispanic/Non-Latino), gender and race (With, Black or African American, all other races) subgroups. Pregnancy At the time of the data cut-off in the Phase 2/3 study (14 Nov 2020), a total of 23 participants had reported pregnancies in the safety database, including 9 participants who withdrew from the vaccination period of the study due to pregnancy. These participants are being followed for pregnancy outcomes. Thus, data on pregnancy are very limited at this stage. Elderly The Phase 2/3 study included >40% of subjects >55 years of age. In general, reactogenicity and AE rate were slightly lower in older compared to younger individuals (stratified according to median age 55 years). No differences in AE frequency were detected among subjects >70 years of age compared to the older age group >55 year. Thus, no specific safety concern is anticipated for the elderly. Immunocompromised individuals Per protocol, participants with chronic stable HIV infection were defined as HIV disease with a documented viral load <50 copies/mL and CD4 count >200 cells/mm3 within 6 months before enrolment, and on stable antiretroviral therapy for at least 6 months. Stratification by CD4 count, efficacy and immunogenicity data are not available at this time but will be provided post-authorisation. Safety data are available for 196 participants with stable HIV infection. The most frequent AEs in the BNT162b2 group were reported in the General Disorders and Administrative Site Conditions SOC including injection site pain, pyrexia, chills, fatigue, injection site erythema, and injection site swelling. Assessment of paediatric data on clinical safety Paediatric individuals age 16 to 17 years of age are included in the Phase 2/3 study that constitutes the safety database in this assessment. The population of subjects aged 16-17 years are limited (n=283). No additional or new AEs were observed compared to adults). Assessment report EMA/707383/2020 Page 110/140 There were no participants in the 16 to 17 years of age group with ≥2 months of safety follow-up at the time of the data cut-off (14 November 2020). The longest duration of follow-up in this age group, at the time of the data cut-off, was 39 days after Dose 2. The adverse event profile for this adolescent age group did not show meaningful differences vs. the young adult group (18 to 55 years of age) in the study. The reactogenicity subset of ~8000 participants (n=4093 BNT162b2; n=4090 placebo) contributing e- diary data included a total of 8 participants in the 16 to 17 years of age group (including participants in both the BNT162b2 group and the placebo group). Available safety data for participants 12 to 15 years of age (N=100; n=49 BNT162b2; n= 51 placebo, as recruited in the Phase 2/3 study under protocol amendment 7) include reactogenicity data (local reactions and systemic events) collected via e-diary up to the safety cut-off date of 14 November 2020. The reported adverse events were primarily reactogenicity events with no serious adverse events. The local reactogenicity profile seems comparable with the young adult population, with however a higher systemic reactogenicity as compared to young adults. In the reactogenicity subset including individuals aged 12-15 years and the 8 individuals aged 16-17 years, the most frequently reported systemic reaction in both treatment groups were fatigue (59.2% in the BNT162b2 group and 25.5% in the placebo group), followed by headache (57.1% BNT162b2, 43.1% placebo). Fever ≥38°C was reported for 26.5% more participants who received BNT162b2 over placebo; two (4.1%) of these participants reported severe fever (>38.9°C to 40.0°C). 2.6.7. Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions Interaction studies with other vaccines have not been performed, which is acceptable given the need to use the vaccine in an emergency situation. The Applicant will conduct a study post-authorisation as indicated in the RMP (see section 2.7). 2.6.8. Discontinuation due to adverse events Among all 43,448 enrolled participants included in the safety database up to the data cut-off date, few participants in the BNT162b2 group (0.2%) and in the placebo group (0.1%) were withdrawn from the study because of AEs. The results were similar to the AEs leading to withdrawal in the group randomised before 9 October 2020 with median follow up of 2 months. Among 19,067 participants with at least 2 months of follow-up time post Dose 2, 1 participant in the BNT162b2 group and no participants in the placebo group had an AE leading to withdrawal from the study. No participants in the 16 to 17 years of age group experienced an AE leading to withdrawal. Among all 43,448 participants, no clinically meaningful differences in AEs leading to withdrawal were observed by age or other subgroups. 2.6.9. Post marketing experience Post-marketing data are not yet available as the vaccine has not been approved in any country at the time of the data cut-off (14-Nov-20). After the cut-off date, it is noted that several countries have recently authorised the vaccine for emergency use (e.g. UK, Canada, US). Two cases of anaphylactoid Assessment report EMA/707383/2020 Page 111/140 reaction out of 138,000 persons vaccinated have been reported in individuals carrying Epipen after initiation of vaccination in one country, which resolved with standard therapy. One case of anaphylaxis was reported in another country (unknown denominator) in a subject without known history of allergies, which required ICU and was then resolved. Post-marketing safety data are expected with the next monthly summary safety report. 2.6.10. Discussion on clinical safety The safety database for BNT162b2 constitutes of two Phase 1 studies (BNT162-012 and C45910013) and one Phase 2/3 study (C4591001) which is still ongoing. The cut-off date for safety data included in this assessment is 14 November 2020. Up to the cut-off date ~44,000 subjects had been recruited and received at least one dose of either BNT162b2 (n=21,720) or placebo (n=21,728). The core safety database of this assessment constitutes of ~19,000 participants who have been followed ≥2 months after the 2nd dose of BNT162b2 (n=9531) or placebo (n=9536). The Applicant has also presented data from a subset of ~38,000 subjects randomised before 9 October 2020 with a median follow-up period of 2 months after Dose 2 of BNT162b2 (n=18,860) or placebo (n=18,846). Demographic characteristics are considered well balanced between vaccine and placebo arm (median follow up 2 months). Subjects were mostly white (83%) and had a median age of 52 years. The younger and older age groups included 57.8% and 42.2% of participants, respectively. Within each age group, most demographic characteristics were similar in the BNT162b2 and placebo groups. Gender was balanced (51% male). Of note, 35% of individuals were obese in study arms. The demographic distribution was different between seropositive and seronegative individuals, with a median age of 43 years in seropositive and of 52 years in seronegative subjects. Furthermore, the seropositive group covered a higher rate of obese individuals (42.2% versus 34.7%). Demographic characteristics in all participants were roughly comparable to those with median follow up of 2 months. Charlson co-morbidity diagnoses were balanced in both study arms (20%). Most prevalent co- morbidities were diabetes (7.8%), COPD (7.8%) and malignant disease (3.9% in the vaccine arm and 3.5% in the placebo arm). Other diagnoses accounted for ≤ 1% of subjects in both study arms (median follow up of 2 months). In the Phase 2/3 study reactogenicity was evaluated in a subset of 8,183 subjects who received BNT162b2 (n=4093) or placebo (n=4090) according to the proposed dosing regimen. The number of subjects aged 16-17 years included in the reactogenicity subset was small (n=8; BNT162b2 n=5; placebo n=3). After each dose, all subjects were asked to report any local reactions, systemic events, and antipyretic/pain medication usage for 7 days, by using an e-diary. Pain at the injection site was the most common local reaction reported in the vaccine group, slightly more frequently reported among subjects 16-55 years (~80%) compared to >55 years (~70%). In the placebo group 8-14% reported pain at injection site. In the vaccine group redness and swelling were overall reported at a frequency of 5-7% in both age groups (vs. placebo 0-1%). Use of antipyretic/pain medication was more common after Dose 2 than after Dose 1 in both age groups, and overall slightly lower among subjects >55 years regardless of the dose (younger group: 28% after dose 1 vs 45% after dose 2; older group: 20% vs 38%). The use of antipyretic/pain medication was less common in the placebo group (younger group: 34% after dose 1 vs 23% after dose 2; older group: 23% vs 18%). 2 Phase I: End of study 28 days after Dose 2. 3 Phase I: participants enrolled in Phase1 in groups that do not proceed to Phase 2/3 (i.e. other doses than 30 µg) may be followed for fewer than 24 months (but no less than 6 months after the last vaccination). Assessment report EMA/707383/2020 Page 112/140 Among the systemic reactions, headache and fatigue were the most common events, and the frequency was higher after Dose 2 compared to Dose 1 (16-55 YOA [47% vs 59%]; >55 YOA [34% vs 51%]). Fever also occurred more frequently after Dose 2 (16-55 YOA [4% vs 16%]; >55 YOA [1% vs 11%]). None of the subjects >55 YOA in the placebo group reported events of fever and 1% of the subjects aged 16-55 years reported fever after the first dose. Overall, the local and systemic reactions were transient and of short duration (resolved within few days after vaccination), the majority were of mild to moderate intensity, and milder and of slightly lower frequency among older subjects (>55 years of age). In the group of 19,067 participants with 2 months follow up after dose 2, 21.4% and 12.6% (vaccine vs placebo) of the subjects reported at least one AE. 13.6%/3.6% reported at least 1 related AE. Rates were lower compared to the whole enrolled trial population (26.7% (vaccine) and 12.2% (placebo)). AEs in subjects with a follow up of at least 2 months belonged most often to the SOCs “General disorders and administration site conditions” (11.9% vs 2.9%), “musculoskeletal reactions” (5.5% vs 2.1%), and “nervous system disorders” (4.2% vs 2.1%), occurring more often in the vaccine than in the placebo arm. PTs comprised most often vaccine typical reactions, i.e. injection site pain, redness and swelling, fever, chills, fatigue, headache as well as myalgia and arthralgia and malaise. Nausea also occurred more often in the vaccine arm (79 cases, i.e. 0.8%, in vaccine vs. 21 cases, i.e. 0.2%, in placebo). Lymphadenopathy was seen in 0.4% subjects in the vaccine arm (38 cases) vs. 0% in the placebo arm (3 cases), or 0.3% of cases in the whole population (0% in placebo arm). Severe AEs were reported by a small number of subjects (≤1.1%) and equally distributed between the study arms. No differences were seen between age groups. Frequencies are comparable in the whole enrolled trial population and when stratifying according to serostatus. Numerical imbalances are observed for several hypersensitivity/immunisation reaction preferred terms (5/3 cases in the ≥ 2 months follow up subset, 13/6 cases in the whole enrolled trial population subset, 4 cases deemed severe (whole enrolled trial population), in the SOC immune system disorders). Lymphadenopathy, nausea, and hypersensitivity are reported more often with the vaccine arm. For these items there is a reasonable possibility of a causal relation to vaccination and they are as such included in the SmPC section 4.8. Subjects were excluded from the Phase 2/3 study if they had a history of severe adverse reaction associated with a vaccine or to any component of the BNT162b2 vaccine. The protocol did not exclude individuals with non-severe allergic reactions to other vaccines or individuals with an allergic reaction, of any severity, to medication, food or environmental allergies. In the Phase 2/3 study 11,673 subjects had a medical history of allergic condition (n=5839 BNT162b2; n=5834 placebo), and among those two cases of allergic AEs (1 in each treatment group) occurred, which were deemed related to study treatment by the investigator. In the ~38,000 study participants with a median of 2 months of safety follow-up after Dose 2, none reported an immediate AE (occurring within 30 minutes after dosing) that was indicative of an allergic reaction to vaccine. There are incoming reports of anaphylactoid reactions from ongoing vaccination campaigns. A warning is included in the SmPC addressing the need of adequate emergency material in place at the vaccination site, which is common practice with any vaccine. Close observation for at least 15 minutes is recommended following vaccination. A second dose of the vaccine should not be given to those who have experienced anaphylaxis to the first dose. Four cases of peripheral facial paralysis were observed in vaccine arm (facial paralysis [n=4 BNT162b2; n=0 placebo] facial paresis [n=0 BNT162b2; n=1 placebo] in total 4/1 whole enrolled trial Assessment report EMA/707383/2020 Page 113/140 population, however the case of paresis was not considered for this calculation). Time to onset after injection with BNT162b2 was 3, 9 and 48 days after Dose 2 and 37 days after Dose 1, which suggest a possible association with the vaccination. The two subjects with a time to onset of 3 and 9 nine days had no previous history of Bell´s palsy, both subjects improved with prednisolone and the events were also deemed related to study intervention by the study physician. Taken together, this was considered to indicate there is a reasonable possibility of a causal relation to the vaccine, and to justify inclusion of peripheral facial paralysis (Bell´s palsy) in the SmPC 4.8 with a frequency as ‘rare’. An imbalance in PT connected to sleep disturbances was noted in the whole enrolled trial population, which was driven by 25 more cases of insomnia-related events (insomnia/sleep disorder/abnormal dreams in the BNT162b2 group versus in the placebo arm). The occurrence of insomnia may plausibly be due to e.g. local/systemic reactogenicity that may occur after vaccination. The CHMP agreed to include insomnia in section 4.8. of the SmPC. A slight imbalance of hyperhidrosis/night sweats was noted in the whole enrolled trial population (n=26/15 BNT162b2 group versus 8/3 in the placebo arm). Hyperhidrosis as a medical term indicates a condition that differs from the sweating associated with episodes of fever. The numerical relation here is not supported by biological plausibility. Injection site pruritus was reported in 31 subjects in the BNT162b2 group compared to 6 subjects in the placebo arm (whole enrolled trial population). These events may be plausibly associated to the injection of BNT162b2 and should therefore be included in the SmPC section 4.8. Pain in the extremity was reported in 183 subjects in the BNT162b2 group and in 34 subjects in the placebo group (whole enrolled trial population). In addition to pain at injection site, which was commonly reported, pain in the extremity is also considered plausibly related to the vaccination and should therefore be included in the SmPC section 4.8. Numerical imbalances in AEs for appendicitis and biliary events are observed (8/4 and 14/5 cases (whole enrolled trial population)), however these are considered not related to study treatment. Cases of (osteo/peri) arthritis (15/15, vaccine/placebo) and psoriasis (1/1, vaccine/placebo) have been observed in the vaccine arm. These were numerically balanced in frequency between vaccine and placebo arm. Autoimmune events will be monitored post-authorisation as described in the RMP. SAEs occurred at a low frequency in both BNT162b2 and the placebo group (0.6%, 56 cases in vaccine vs. 53 cases in placebo) in subjects with ≥2 months of follow-up post Dose 2, and a similar frequency was observed in the total study population. One SAE of lymphadenopathy and one SAE of shoulder injury were considered related to study intervention. No cases of related SAEs were reported in the adolescent group (only one case of facial bone fracture). Six events of death (2 in the BNT162b2 group and 4 in the placebo group) have been reported in the entire study population, all deemed unrelated to the vaccine. The rate of subjects discontinuing participation in the study due to AEs was low in both study arms (0.2%/0.1%). The subgroup of seropositive subjects is limited in size (n=545 BNT162b2; n=580 Placebo). A stratification according to serostatus for AE investigation was specifically performed in individuals with a follow up of at least one month (median Follow up 2 months) and ≥2 months. Most reported SOCs are similar to those identified in the ≥ 2 months population. AE rate in seropositive individuals was lower (22%) compared to seronegative individuals (27%) and no specific safety concern is detected in this subpopulation. 23 participants reported pregnancies in the safety database, nine of them were withdrawn from the study due to the pregnancy status. These participants will be followed up for pregnancy outcomes. Assessment report EMA/707383/2020 Page 114/140 The Applicant has not provided a specific analysis of elderly individuals > 70 years included in the development program. In general, reactogenicity and AE rate were slightly lower in older compared to younger individuals (stratified according to median age 55 years). Thus, no specific safety concern is anticipated for the elderly. Data on immunocompromised individuals are limited, which was raised as missing information in the RMP and will be further followed up. 196 participants with stable HIV infection were included in the trial and reported AEs that were mostly reactogenicity-related with no SAEs. No specific safety concern is detected in this subpopulation. From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-marketing have been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics as applicable. Assessment of paediatric data on clinical safety The longest duration of follow-up in the 16-17 years of age group, at the time of the data cut-off, was 39 days after Dose 2. The adverse event profile for this adolescent age group did not show meaningful differences vs. the young adult group (18 to 55 years of age) in the study, albeit is numerically lower (11.6%/4.8%, vaccine/placebo). The reactogenicity subset included a total of 8 participants in the 16 to 17 years of age group (including participants in both the BNT162b2 group and the placebo group). Available safety data for participants 12 to 15 years of age (N=100; n=49 BNT162b2; n= 51 placebo, as recruited in the Phase 2/3 study under protocol amendment 7) show reactogenicity events (local reactions and systemic events) with no serious adverse events. The local reactogenicity profile seems comparable with the young adult population, with however a higher systemic reactogenicity as compared to young adults. Overall, the safety of BNT162b2 in individuals 16-17 years of age is extrapolated from young adults in general. Additional safety data needed in the context of a conditional MA The final clinical study report for study C4591001 will be submitted no later than December 2023 and is subject to a specific obligation laid down in the MA. 2.6.11. Conclusions on the clinical safety The safety evaluation is based on one ongoing Phase 2/3 study that at the time of data cut-off (14- Nov-20) included 43,448 subjects who received either two doses of BNT162b2 30µg (n=21 720) or placebo (n=21 728). Overall, the reported reactogenicity profile are in line with any authorised vaccine. In addition, the frequency of reported AEs and SAEs were low. The emerging safety profile is presently considered favourable. Long term safety data, interaction with other vaccines, data on use in pregnancy and other subgroups (e.g. frail subjects, or subjects with pre-existing autoimmune diseases) are missing at this stage. The lack of long-term follow up renders the data provided non-comprehensive. Therefore, the delivery of the final C4951001 study report, including a 2-year follow up of the studied population, is classified as a specific obligation in the context of a conditional marketing authorisation. The plan for the generation of further safety data post authorisation is described in the section below. Assessment report EMA/707383/2020 Page 115/140 2.7. Risk Management Plan Safety Specification Summary of safety concerns The applicant has submitted an RMP including the following summary of safety concerns: Important identified risks Anaphylaxis Important potential risks Vaccine-associated enhanced disease (VAED) including Vaccine- associated enhanced respiratory disease (VAERD) Missing information Use during pregnancy and while breast feeding Use in immunocompromised patients Use in frail patients with co-morbidities (e.g. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes, chronic neurological disease, cardiovascular disorders) Use in patients with autoimmune or inflammatory disorders Interaction with other vaccines Long term safety data Risks considered important for inclusion of the summary of safety concerns The review of available safety data, including post-marketing data emerging from use in the UK and US, the experience with biological products and other vaccines leads to the conclusion that anaphylaxis is an important identified risk for Comirnaty. This safety concern will be followed up via routine pharmacovigilance activities and in the planned and ongoing safety studies and reported in the monthly summary safety reports and PSURs. Any important potential risks that may be specific to vaccination for COVID-19 (e.g. vaccine associated enhanced respiratory disease) should be taken into account. The Applicant has included VAED/VAERD as an important potential risk and will further investigate it in the ongoing pivotal study and a post- authorisation safety study. Missing information Since pregnant and breast-feeding women were excluded from the study, no information is available for those populations. It is agreed to include use during pregnancy and while breastfeeding as missing information in the RMP. At the data cut-off of 14 Nov-20, 10-14 weeks safety data are available. Thus, long-term safety is included as missing information and will be characterised as part of the continuation of the pivotal clinical trial and the PASS. Interaction with other vaccines, has not been evaluated in clinical trials and may be of interest to prescribers. As elderly individuals will be one target group for vaccination, and they often may need vaccination with other vaccines such as influenza and pneumococcus vaccines, further data is Assessment report EMA/707383/2020 Page 116/140 requested. The Applicant commits to conduct a study of the co-administration of Comirnaty with inactivated quadrivalent influenza vaccine. Data from use in frail patients with co-morbidities (e.g. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes, chronic neurological disease, cardiovascular disorders), is limited, and it is desirable to gather further data in these groups. Therefore, use in frail patients with co-morbidities (e.g. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes, chronic neurological disease, cardiovascular disorders) has been included as missing information in the RMP. Furthermore, information is limited on the use in patients with autoimmune or inflammatory disorders, as well as in immunocompromised patients. Thus, these groups are also included as missing information. Such missing information will be collected in the post-authorisation safety studies. Risks not considered important for inclusion in the summary of safety concerns The reactogenicity is in line with what can be expected from a vaccine, and it is considered acceptable to not include those events in the list of safety specifications. Pharmacovigilance Plan Routine pharmacovigilance activities Routine pharmacovigilance activities beyond the receipt and review and submission of ADRs include: • A web-based AE reporting portal will be available for vaccine providers (e.g. pharmacists, nurses, physicians and others who administer vaccines) and recipients, to assist with anticipated high volume of reports (based on expectations of a large target population for vaccination). The portal will capture key adverse event data in the initial interaction and will provide automated intake into the Pfizer safety database via E2B for safety review. • Signal detection activities for the lifecycle of vaccines consist of individual AE assessment at case receipt, regular aggregate review of cases for trends and statistically disproportionately reported product-adverse event pairs. Aggregated and statistical reviews of data are conducted utilizing Pfizer’s software interactive tools. Safety signal evaluation requires the collection, analysis and assessment of information to evaluate potential causal associations between an event and the product and includes subsequent qualitative or quantitative characterization of the relevant safety risk to determine appropriate continued pharmacovigilance and risk mitigation actions. Signal detection activities for the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, will occur on a weekly basis. In addition, observed versus expected analyses will be conducted as appropriate as part of routine signal management activity. • Routine signal detection activities for the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine will include routine and specific review of AEs consistent with the AESI list provided in the RMP. • In addition, published literature will be reviewed weekly for individual case reports and broader signal detection purposes. • Regulatory authority safety alerts monitoring, to detect and further investigate potential signals being raised on other areas outside of EU. • A specific adverse reaction follow-up questionnaire intended to capture clinical details about the nature and severity of COVID-19 illness particularly in relation to potential cases of vaccine lack of effect or VAED. Assessment report EMA/707383/2020 Page 117/140 • In addition to routine 6-monthly PSUR production, monthly summary safety reports will be compiled and submitted to EMA, to support timely and continuous benefit risk evaluations during the pandemic. Minimum data to be submitted include: • Interval and cumulative number of reports, stratified by report type (medically confirmed/not) and by seriousness (including fatal separately); • Interval and cumulative number of reports, overall and by age groups and in special populations (e.g. pregnant women); • Interval and cumulative number of reports per HLT and SOC; • Summary of the designated medical events; • Reports per EU country; • Exposure data (including age-stratified); • Changes to reference safety information in the interval, and current CCDS; • Ongoing and closed signals in the interval; • AESI reports – numbers and relevant cases; • Fatal reports – numbers and relevant cases; • Risk/benefit considerations. • The submission of monthly reports complements the submission of PSURs (requested initially every six months). The need and frequency of submission of the summary safety reports will be re- evaluated based on the available evidence from post-marketing after 6 months (6 submissions). • Joint adverse event and product complaint (including available batch/lot information) trending reviews will be conducted routinely by the Applicant. The proposed routine pharmacovigilance activities are considered appropriate for the safety profile of the product and the pandemic circumstances. Traceability Full traceability from manufacturing to vaccination administration site is crucial to ensure maintenance of the cold-chain as well as for pharmacovigilance purposes should assessment of a safety signal need to be performed by batch/lot. The Applicant’s proposal to ensure traceability include: • SmPC 4.4 labelling to raise HCP awareness regarding the need to clearly record the name and batch of the vaccine to improve traceability; • a tracking device on every vaccine shipping container that provides real-time monitoring of GPS location and temperature 24 hours per day, 7 days per week; • vaccine carton labelling also containing a 2-D barcode which has the batch/lot and expiry embedded within • additional tools for vaccinators to record manufacturer and lot/batch information at the time of vaccination including a Traceability and Vaccination Reminder Card and peel-off labels (stickers with brand name and lot/batch numbers), acknowledging that each Member State will decided if and how the tools will be used, in accordance with the national provisions for pharmacovigilance. Assessment report EMA/707383/2020 Page 118/140 Each shipment to a vaccination site should be accompanied with a sufficient number of corresponding vaccinee traceability and vaccination reminder cards; the lot/batch numbers will be for the first batches distributed copied manually by the vaccinators, with the Applicant’s commitment that by 31 January 2021 all batches shipped will be accompanied at the receipt point in the Member States by sufficient peel-off labels to facilitate the recording of brand name and lot/batch number both in the vaccinators’ records and the vaccinee traceability and vaccination reminder cards, where the Member States will require it. The Traceability and Vaccination Reminder will include: • Space for name of vaccinee; • Vaccine brand name and manufacturer name; • Space for due date and actual date of first and second doses, and associated batch/lot number; • Reminder to retain the card and bring to the appointment for the second dose of the vaccine, and keep it thereafter; • QR code that links to additional information; • Adverse event reporting information. Additional pharmacovigilance activities The Applicant proposes the following 11 studies, of which 1 global, 3 in Europe only, 2 in Europe and US, and 3 in US only; the countries where 2 studies will be conducted are not available at this time. There are 6 interventional studies (C4591001, C4591015, BNT162-01 Cohort 13, C4591018, 1 study in high risk adults and 1 study addressing co-administration with another vaccine) and 5 non- Interventional studies (4 safety and 1 effectiveness): Study (study short name, and title) Status (planned/on- going) Summary of Objectives Safety concerns addressed Milestone Due dates Category 2 C4591001 Ongoing The objective of the study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity and efficacy of COVID- 19 mRNA vaccine An unfavorable imbalance between the vaccine and control groups in the frequency of COVID-19, in particular for severe COVID-19, may suggest the occurrence of vaccine associated enhanced disease.

Interaction with other vaccines. Protocol submission: 30-Sep-2021 Final CSR submission: 31-Dec-2022 Non-Interventional Post Approval Safety Studies (4) The Applicant proposes 4 complementary studies of real-world safety of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine that use multiple data sources and study designs. Study C4591010 will be conducted in the EU using primary data collection to monitor a cohort of vaccinees and evaluate risk of safety events of interest reflecting the AESI list. A draft protocol C4591010 has been provided. Additionally, Pfizer, on behalf of the Applicant, will sponsor one or more PASS using secondary electronic health records data sources in Europe based on a master surveillance protocol developed through the ACCESS project. Two additional studies will be conducted using US data: o 1 study using secondary data from EHR of active military and their families (C4591011), o 1 study using secondary data from EHR of patients included in the Veterans Healthcare Administration system (C4591012). The draft protocols for the proposed safety studies in the US (C4591011 and C4591012) have been provided. Interventional studies (6) The Applicant proposes 6 interventional studies, of which 2 are ongoing and 4 are planned. • Study C4591001 is an ongoing Phase 1/2/3, placebo-controlled, randomized, observer-blind, dose-finding study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity, and efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 RNA vaccine candidates against COVID-19 in healthy individuals. At the time of the data cut-off date in Study C4591001 (14 November 2020), a total of 21,720 participants received at least one dose of the candidate vaccine. • Study BNT162-01 Cohort 13 is an ongoing multi-site (Germany), Phase I/II, 2-part, dose escalation trial investigating the safety and immunogenicity of four prophylactic SARS-CoV-2 RNA vaccines against COVID-19 using different dosing regimens in 30 immunocompromised adults. • Study C4591015 is a planned clinical study to assess safety and immunogenicity in pregnant women who receive COVID 19 mRNA vaccine. • Study C4591018 is a planned study of BNT162b2 in 100 adults receiving a stable dose of immunomodulators for the treatment of stable rheumatoid arthritis (RA), in two cohorts (50 tofacitinib, 50 TNF inhibitors). Subjects will be studied for safety, immunogenicity by neutralizing antibody titer, and evidence of asymptomatic infection by N-antigen antibodies. Assessment report EMA/707383/2020 Page 122/140 • A planned Phase II safety and immunogenicity study (Safety and immunogenicity in high risk adults) in up to 150 immunocompromised adults (with a range of primary immunocompromising conditions and/or receiving immunocompromising treatments. • Co-administration study with seasonal influenza vaccine study investigating the safety and immunogenicity of Comirnaty and quadrivalent seasonal influenza vaccine when administered separately or concomitantly. Non-Interventional PASS in Pregnancy The Applicant’s proposed strategy to assess vaccination during pregnancy will be implemented in 2 stages. It is anticipated that initial use in pregnancy will be very limited; therefore, initially this information will derive from the 4 of the real-world safety studies (C4591010, C4591011, and ACCESS/VAC4EU), described in the preceding section. Study C4591012 is focused on patients in the Veterans Health Administration system and is not expected to capture many pregnancies given the demographics of the source population. The findings from studies’ interim analysis (where planned) will inform a strategy to assess pregnancy outcomes as vaccination in pregnancy expands. The Applicant will consider established EU pregnancy research recommendations such as CONSIGN (COVID-19 infectiOn aNd medicineS In pregnancy) when developing any pregnancy related study objectives. The applicant’s commitment and considerations are noted to evaluate pregnancy outcomes in a PASS using established EU pregnancy research recommendations such as CONSIGN (COVID-19 infectiOn aNd medicineS In pregnancy) when developing any pregnancy related study objectives. Further feasibility analyses are awaited with RMP updates post-approval. Non-Interventional Post-Approval Effectiveness study (1) The Applicant will conduct at least one non-interventional study (test negative design) of individuals presenting to the hospital or emergency room with symptoms of potential COVID-19 illness in a real- world setting (C4591014). The effectiveness of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine will be estimated against laboratory confirmed COVID 19 illness requiring admission to the Emergency Department (ED) or hospital where SARS-CoV-2 is identified. These studies will allow to determine the effectiveness of Pfizer’s vaccine in a real-world setting and against severe disease, and in specific racial, ethnic, and age groups. The studies proposed below are under evaluation as potential commitments; studies are presented by geographical area (US and EU). Overall conclusions on the Pharmacovigilance Plan The proposed post-authorisation pharmacovigilance development plan is sufficient to identify and characterise the risks of the product. Routine pharmacovigilance remains sufficient to monitor the effectiveness of the risk minimisation measures. Plans for post-authorisation efficacy studies None proposed. Assessment report EMA/707383/2020 Page 123/140 Risk minimisation measures Routine Risk Minimisation Measures Potential Medication Errors The Applicant included a discussion on potential medication errors which is endorsed: Large scale public health approaches for mass vaccination may represent changes to standard vaccine treatment process, thereby potentially introducing the risk of medication errors related to: reconstitution and administration, vaccination scheme, storage conditions, errors associated with a multi-dose vial, and once other COVID-19 vaccines are available, confusion with other COVID-19 vaccines. These potential medication errors are mitigated through the information in the SmPC and further materials for healthcare providers which will be made available to the Member States to be integrated in the national campaign for communication, as needed. • SmPC (section 6.6) contains instructions for reconstitution and administration, vaccination scheme, and storage conditions of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine. • A poster with step-by-step instruction for vaccine storage, dose planning and preparation, and administration is available, which can be conspicuously displayed in settings where vaccine is to be administered for ongoing reference. • Brochures for safe handling of the vaccine and dry ice will accompany vaccine shipments. • Medical information call centres will be available for healthcare providers to obtain information on use of the vaccine. • Traceability and Vaccination Reminder card will be provided with the pre-printed manufacturer name, dates of vaccination, batch/lot as a mitigation effort for potential confusion between vaccines. • Peel-off labels with lot/batch number These available resources will inform healthcare providers on the proper preparation and administration of the vaccine and reduce the potential for medication errors in the context of a mass vaccination campaign. Additionally, the patient information leaflet and, in those MSs where applicable, a Traceability and Vaccination Reminder card informs patients of the vaccine received so that a series is completed with the same product. Summary of additional risk minimisation measures None proposed. The Applicant stated that Routine risk minimisation activities are sufficient to manage the safety concerns of the medicinal product. This is acceptable.

Overall conclusions on risk minimisation measures The proposed risk minimisation measures are sufficient to minimise the risks of the product in the proposed indication(s). Assessment report EMA/707383/2020 Page 127/140 Summary of the risk management plan The public summary of the RMP is acceptable. Conclusion on the RMP The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 1.0 is acceptable. 2.8. Pharmacovigilance Pharmacovigilance system The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. Furthermore, During the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic situation, the MAH shall submit summary safety reports submitted to EMA, including spontaneously reported data and data from compassionate use and expanded access programs. The applicant did not request alignment of the PSUR cycle with the international birth date (IBD). The new EURD list entry will therefore use the EBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 2.9. Product information 2.9.1. User consultation The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 2.9.2. Labelling exemptions The following exemptions from labelling and serialization requirements have been granted on the basis of article 63.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC. In addition, the derogations granted should be seen in the context of the flexibilities described in the Questions and Answers on labelling flexibilities for COVID-19 vaccines (EMA/689080/2020 rev.1, from 16 December 2020) 4 document which aims at facilitating the preparedness work of COVID-19 vaccine developers and the associated logistics of early printing packaging activities. The ultimate goal is to facilitate the large scale and rapid deployment of COVID- 19 vaccines for EU citizens within the existing legal framework. Labelling exemptions US packaging specific derogations (valid for December ’20 and January ‘21) All EU Members States (MSs), as well as Norway and Iceland, have agreed to grant a temporary 4 Available at https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/other/questions-answers-labelling-flexibilities-covid19- vaccines_en.pdf, last co nsulted on 21 December 2021. Assessment report EMA/707383/2020 Page 128/140 exemption to allow the placing in the EU market of the US packaging, under the following conditions: a. The validity is only temporary and the MAH shall switch to the EU labelling requirements by February ’21; b. The US pack will have included a Quick Response (QR) code which the vaccine recipient could scan and gain access to the package leaflet (PL) in his/her national language; c. The MAH shall supply a separate printed PL in the national language(s) of those MSs that require so, i.e. Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, France and Greece. All other MSs, that have granted a temporary exemption for an EN only PL, will receive 5 printed copies of the EN PL with each shipment of the vaccine. EU packaging specific derogations (from February ’21 onwards) a. Outer and immediate labelling will be provided in English only. The MAH shall provide outer and immediate labelling in all EU languages by 2nd Q 2022. This exemption is justified on the deep-frozen storage/shipping requirements and the necessity to label batches ahead of time. Production of different vaccine packs in different languages will significantly reduce the supply chain efficiency. The multiple changes on packaging lines will result in significant time and capacity losses and would slow down the rapid deployment of COVID-19 vaccines. Moreover, English only labelling will better help to manage a shortage situation in one country by using immediately the supply from another country. b. A printed package leaflet will be provided in the national language(s) for those MSs that require so, i.e. Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, France and Greece. All other MSs, that have granted a temporary exemption for an EN only PL, will receive 5 printed copies of the EN PL with each shipment of the vaccine. In addition, a QR code printed on the outer label and the PL will provide access to the package leaflet in the national language(s). The MAH shall provide a printed package leaflet in all EU languages by 2nd Q 2022. The MAH shall engage with the National Competent Authorities (other than the 6 mentioned above) to discuss and speed up the provision of PLs in the respective national language(s) of the MSs concerned. The MAH shall also contact MSs directly to agree on the exact numbers of PLs to be distributed, again in line with the published Q&A on labelling flexibilities. c. The Blue Box will be omitted for the initial batches. The MAH shall provide the Blue Box via a QR code at a later stage following agreement on exact timing of implementation with the National Competent Authorities in each MS. d. The inclusion of the EU Marketing Authorisation number in the labelling will be implemented with the switch from US packaging to EU compliant packs in February 2021. Exemption from the obligation of serialisation US packaging specific derogations (valid for December ’20 and January ‘21) a. It is acceptable that the US pack will be placed in the EU market without serialisation according to the EU FMD requirements. Only the Global Trade Item Number (GTIN) will be common for US & EU and this will be printed on the US pack. EU packaging specific derogations (from February until March ’21) - All EU Member States have accepted a temporary derogation from serialisation for the EU pack from February until the end of March 2021. Assessment report EMA/707383/2020 Page 129/140 - The MAH shall provide two progress reports on the serialisation: a first by 1st of February ‘21 and a second by 1st of March ‘21 referring to details on the progress achieved in terms of ensuring compliance, e.g. proof of acquiring the relevant equipment, the date for the validation, the proof of contract to connect to the European Medicines Verification Organisation. - The MAH shall provide additional mitigating measures, e.g. immediate reporting of any stolen product during the period of exemption, reporting of any counterfeit or falsified vaccine in the EU or third countries in the legal supply or internet, reconciliation of product distributed and used in the respective territory. 2.9.3.

Disease or condition COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, which appeared in the Wuhan province in China in 2019 and has spread world-wide during 2020 ever since, causing WHO to declare a pandemic on 11 March 2020. The virus infects primarily the airways and causes a broad spectrum of respiratory infections from asymptomatic infection to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The pandemic is ongoing despite unprecedented efforts to control the outbreak. According to ECDC histologic findings from the lungs include diffuse alveolar damage similar to lung injury caused by other respiratory viruses, such as MERS-CoV and influenza virus. A distinctive characteristic of SARS-CoV-2 infection is vascular damage, with severe endothelial injury, widespread thrombosis, microangiopathy and angiogenesis. As of 1 December 2020, there have been >63 million globally confirmed COVID-19 cases and >1.4 million deaths, with 191 countries/regions affected. At the time of this marketing application submission, confirmed cases and mortality continue to rise globally. The ongoing pandemic remains a significant challenge to public health and economic stability worldwide. Comirnaty is intended for active immunisation against SARS-CoV-2, thereby preventing COVID-19. 3.1.2. Available therapies and unmet medical need There is currently no approved vaccine in the EU available to prevent COVID-19. Several development programs are ongoing globally and currently other applications are under evaluation by regulatory authorities worldwide. There is a very high global demand for vaccines to help contain the pandemic and decrease morbidity and mortality in at risk groups. 3.1.3. Main clinical studies The clinical development consists of one FIH phase 1 study (BNT162-01) in younger and older adults (18-55 years and 56-85 years) comparing 4 vaccine candidates, and one pivotal clinical study, C4591001 (or BNT162-02). The pivotal study is a phase 1/2/3 placebo-controlled, randomised, observer-blind, dose finding, multicentre study performed in the US (start date 4 May 2020), Argentina, Brazil, Turkey, Germany, and South Africa, to evaluate the safety, immunogenicity and efficacy of a SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine candidate against COVID-19 in healthy adults. The phase 1 part of the study was designed for dose evaluation of 2 vaccines: BNT162b1 and BNT162b2 in younger (18-55 years) and older (65-85 years) adults. The Phase 2 part was designed to confirm safety and immunogenicity of the selected vaccine, BNT162b2, in the first 360 subjects enrolled in the Phase 2/3 part of the study. The Phase 2/3 part of the study was designed to enrol up to 43,998 subjects (randomised 1:1 to BNT162b2 or placebo) to receive BNT162b2 at the dose of 30 µg, given as 2 IM injections 21 day apart (within 19 to 42 days), for an efficacy assessment in addition to safety and exploratory immunogenicity assessments. Assessment report EMA/707383/2020 Page 131/140 The primary endpoint was symptomatic COVID-19 incidence per 1000 person-years of follow-up based on centrally or locally confirmed nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) in subjects without serological or virological evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection before and during vaccination regimen (cases confirmed ≥7 days after Dose 2), and in subjects with and without evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection before and during vaccination regimen. The study was event-driven, i.e. the final efficacy analysis was to be triggered by 162 cases; in practice 170 cases were reached. 3.2. Favourable effects The overall vaccine efficacy against symptomatic laboratory confirmed COVID-19 from 7 days after dose 2 was 95.0% (95% CI 90.0, 97.9) in subjects ≥16 years of age without prior evidence of SARS- CoV2 infection and 94.6% (95% CI 89.6, 97.6) in all subjects regardless of prior evidence of SARS- CoV-2 infection (primary endpoint). This outcome met the pre-specified success criteria. Vaccine efficacy after dose 1 to before dose 2 was 52.4% (95% CI 29.5, 68.4). Vaccine efficacy from 10 days after dose 1 to before dose 2 was estimated to be 86.7% (95% CI 68.6, 95). The efficacy analyses in the all- available efficacy populatio n (including participants who had protocol violations), showed consistent results with those in the primary analysis population. The efficacy analyses using CDC defined symptoms to identify a COVID -19 case gave similar efficacy results as the primary endpoints. The VE in each demographic subgroup analysed, as defined by age (including subjects >65 years), sex, race, ethnicity, and country and in individuals with comorbidities including obesity, diabetes, hypertension and cardiopulmonary diseases was >90%. In the obese population, VE was 95.4% (CI 95% 86.0%, 99.1%). VE among 65 -74-year-olds was 92.9% (CI95% 53.1%, 99.8%). VE among >75 -year-olds was 100% (CI95% -13.1%, 100.0) with 0 cases in the vaccine group and 5 cases in the placebo group. VE among >65 years and at risk of severe COVID-19 was 91.7% (95% 44.2%, 99.8%). Secondary efficacy analyses suggested benefit of the vaccine in preventing severe COVID-19, but the number of cases after second dose was very low, 1 case in the vaccine group and 4 cases in placebo group. Counting cases from after dose 1, there were 1 case in the vaccine group and 9 cases in the placebo group. Phase 1 and phase 2 immunogenicity data from both the pivotal study C4591001 and supportive study BNT162-01 have shown robust humoral responses after vaccination with 2 doses of BNT162b2 at 30 μg in both younger (18-55 years) and older adults (age groups 56-85 years and 65-85 years), and both in terms of neutralising antibodies and IgG-antigen binding antibodies. The second dose given 21 days post-dose 1 induced a marked boosting effect in both younger and older adults. Responses were generally faster and higher in younger adults than in older adults. The levels of neutralizing antibodies titres were moderate 21 days after dose 1. The peak of neutralizing antibodies titres was reached 14 days post-dose 2 in older adults versus 7 days post-dose 2 in younger adults. Immune responses were maintained up to 1-month post-dose 2 in both age groups based on available data. Study BNT162-01 provides evidence for T cell-mediated immune response, with antigen-induced IFNγ expression demonstrating a Th1 CD4+ and CD8+ phenotype following the second dose of vaccine. For the 30 μg dose cohort vaccinated with BNT162b2, CD4 and CD8 cytokine responses showed the same intensity in adults and older adults. The immunogenicity results are only considered supportive at this stage, as no correlate of protection has been established. The immune responses support the need for two doses, as neutralising antibody Assessment report EMA/707383/2020 Page 132/140 levels increased substantially following the second dose compared to the first dose. Cell mediated immune responses were demonstrated in very few subjects in phase 1 but confirm a Th1 dominated cytokine pattern. 3.3. Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects Based on the available limited data, no reliable conclusion on the efficacy of the vaccine against severe COVID-19 can be drawn from 7 days after the second dose (secondary endpoint). The estimated efficacy against severe COVID-19 occurring at least 7 days after dose 2 was 66.4%, with a large and negative lower bound CI (95% CI: -124.8%; 96.3%). Only a limited number of events occurred at the cut- off date of analysis (1 and 4 cases in the vaccine and placebo groups respectively). The posterior probability for the true vaccine efficacy ≥ 30% (74.29%) did not meet the pre -specified success criterion. Consequently, the efficacy against the severe disease across subgroups, notably certain populations at high-risk of severe COVID-19 cannot be estimated (elderly and subjects with comorbidities). Efficacy against asymptomatic infection is not available but, notwithstanding all the limitations, will be assessed through seroconversion of N- binding antibodies in BNT162b2 and placebo recipients who did not experience COVID-19. The pivotal study was not designed to assess the effect of the vaccine against transmission of SARS- CoV-2 from subjects who would be infected after vaccination. The efficacy of the vaccine in preventing SARS-CoV-2 shedding and transmission, in particular from individuals with asymptomatic infection, can only be evaluated post-authorisation in epidemiological or specific clinical studies. Duration of protection has currently been followed up for approximately 100 days after dose 1. Data on longer term protection are anticipated to the extent that the ongoing phase 3 study can continue as planned with a placebo group. The assessment of efficacy over a period of at least 6 months is expected to determine the need and the appropriate time of a booster dose. There seems to be at least a partial onset of protection after the first dose, but this remains unconfirmed at this stage. There are very limited or no data in immunocompromised subjects and in pregnant women. Efficacy in subjects aged 16-17 years is extrapolated from young adults as no cases of disease were reported in this small group at this stage. Available data do not suffice to establish efficacy in subjects seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 at baseline, and subjects with a known history of COVID-19. However, efficacy is anticipated in this group, to the extent that they are not naturally protected against re-infection, which is presently incompletely characterised. 3.4. Unfavourable effects The safety of Comirnaty was evaluated in participants 16 years of age and older in 2 clinical studies (BNT162-01 and C4591001) that included 21,744 participants that have received at least one dose of Comirnaty. In Study C4591001, a total of 21,720 participants 16 years of age or older received at least 1 dose of Comirnaty and a total of 21,728 participants 16 years of age or older received placebo (including 138 and 145 adolescents 16 and 17 years of age in the vaccine and placebo groups, respectively). A total of 20,519 participants 16 years of age or older received 2 doses of Comirnaty. Assessment report EMA/707383/2020 Page 133/140 At the time of the analysis of Study C4591001, a total of 19,067 (9,531 Comirnaty and 9,536 placebo) participants 16 years of age or older were evaluated for safety for at least 2 months after the second dose of Comirnaty. This included a total of 10,727 (5,350 Comirnaty and 5,377 placebo) participants 16 to 55 years of age and a total of 8,340 (4,181 Comirnaty and 4,159 placebo) participants 56 years and older. Reactogenicity was evaluated in a subset of 8183 subjects (n=4093 vaccinated; n=4090 placebo) up to 7 days after each dose. Regarding reactogenicity, the most frequent adverse reactions in participants 16 years of age and older were injection site pain (> 80%), fatigue (> 60%), headache (> 50%), myalgia and chills (> 30%), arthralgia (> 20%), pyrexia and injection site swelling (> 10%). All reactions were usually mild or moderate in intensity and resolved within a few days after vaccination. A slightly lower frequency of reactogenicity events was associated with greater age. The frequency of headache, fatigue and fever was higher after Dose 2 in both age groups. Regarding AEs, at least one AE was reported in 21% of the vaccinated subjects and in 13% of the placebo arm. The frequency of severe AEs was low (<1%) in both study arms. The most frequently reported SOC were “General disorders and administration site conditions (11.9% vs 2.9%)”, “musculoskeletal reactions” (5.5% vs 2.1%), and “nervous system disorders” (4.2% vs 2.1%). PTs comprised mainly of vaccine typical reactions such as injection site pain, headache, fever, fatigue, malaise as well as myalgia and arthralgia. For subjects with a follow-up of ≥2 months, SAE were reported at a low frequency (0.5-0.6%) in both the vaccine and the placebo group, with no clinically meaningful differences by age, baseline serostatus, ethnicity, race or sex. Lymphadenopathy (0.4% with vaccine vs 0.0% with placebo, or 0.3% of cases in the whole population 0% in placebo arm) and nausea (0.8% with vaccine vs 0.2% with placebo) were reported to occur more often in the vaccine group compared to the placebo grouping the whole enrolled trial population. Numerical imbalances in reporting were observed for insomnia, injection site pruritus and pain in extremity. Since these are supported by a biologically plausible relation to vaccination, these AEs are reflected in the SmPC. Acute peripheral paralysis was reported in 4 vs. 0 cases (vaccine vs placebo) in the whole study population, of which 2 cases were deemed related to study treatment (see section 2.6.10). For acute peripheral paralysis, there is a reasonable possibility of a causal relation to vaccination and should therefore be included in the SmPC. In the ~38,000 study participants with a median of 2 months of safety follow-up after Dose 2, none reported an immediate AE (occurring within 30 minutes after dosing) that was indicative of an allergic reaction to vaccine. Three reports of anaphylaxis were identified during vaccination campaigns by the time this report was written. Few cases of hypersensitivity/immunisation reaction events have been observed with the vaccine (13 vs 6 cases) in the whole study population. Hypersensitivity should be annotated in the SmPC, section 4.8. 3.5. Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects Long term safety data is not available at this stage, however the Phase 2/3 study will follow the included subjects up to 2 years post vaccination, so these data are expected post-authorisation. AEs were slightly lower in subjects seropositive to SARS-CoV-2 at baseline (22% vs. 27% in seronegatives), however the number of such subjects was limited (vaccinated n=558; placebo n=590). Assessment report EMA/707383/2020 Page 134/140 Data on immunocompromised individuals is limited, as only 196 participants with stable HIV infection were included in the study. No specific safety concern was detected. Data from exposure during pregnancy is very limited. Up to the cut-off date 23 pregnancies have been reported in the Phase 2/3 trial and will be followed up for outcome. Multiple long-term pharmacoepidemiology safety studies are planned to be conducted in order to confirm the safety profile in the already studied population as well as in a broader population including pregnant, immunocompromised and very elderly subjects. There is no data available on interaction with other vaccines given in co-administration. In the Phase 2/3 study, the total number of included subjects aged 16-17 years was smaller compared to other age groups (n=138 BNT162b; n=145 placebo), however no safety concerns were identified. Uncertainties remain regarding causality association of acute peripheral paralysis to vaccination due to the limited number of cases, which are consistent with background rates. Nevertheless, facial paralysis will be included as an adverse event of special interest (AESI) for pharmacovigilance monitoring and in the active surveillance study protocols. While apart from facial paralysis, whose aetiology is currently unknown, no possible autoimmune adverse events where identified as causally related to vaccination, rare events of this nature cannot be excluded based on the size of the available data set. There is a theoretical risk, based on non-clinical data with MERS and SARS vaccines, of vaccine- associated enhanced disease (VAED) including vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease (VAERD), however no cases were identified in clinical studies with COVID-19 vaccines, including Comirnaty, and the characterisation of the immune response does not indicate a risk profile in this regard (Th1 skewed). This vaccine contains two new components (cationic lipid ALC-0315 and PEGylated liquid ALC-0159) in the LNP, for which there is limited experience. Some uncertainties remain regarding the ALC-0315 long half-life. Regarding PEG related toxicity which is known to depend on the dose, dose frequency, duration of treatment and molecular weight of the PEG protein, immunogenicity is not expected to be an issue due to the low molecular weight of this PEG (<2KDa). The scientific data available at this stage do not raise noticeable concerns regarding immunogenicity or immunotoxicity of the PEG, but current evidence is not definitive. 3.6.

Assessment report EMA/707383/2020 Page 136/140 3.7. Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 3.7.1. Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects Overall, substantial efficacy in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 infection has been demonstrated, as well as an acceptable safety profile in a large phase 3 study. Uncertainties relate to the characterization of active substance and finished product. Given the comparable immunogenicity from 10 to 30µg doses, an impact on efficacy of the acceptance of somewhat lower levels of intact mRNA in the commercial product is not considered likely. Furthermore, based on low levels and biological plausibility, an impact of mRNA impurities on safety is deemed unlikely (see section 3.7.3). Due to the limited extent of safety follow-up, the delivery of final data from the full 2-year follow up in the pivotal clinical trial are considered important to confirm the current knowledge. With regards to the balance of efficacy and safety benefits and risks, it is overwhelmingly positive for subjects at risk of severe COVID-19, including the elderly and those with comorbid conditions, which are known to increase the risk of complication and death due to infection. Uncertainties concerning the pharmaceutical characterization of the commercial product are compatible with a positive benefit/risk balance. This pertains not only to adults but, by extrapolation, to individuals 16-17 years of age. Data are limited in individuals seropositive against SARS-CoV-2 at baseline. Available data however do not indicate any specific safety concerns, and efficacy is anticipated also in this subset. There are no data on use in pregnant women, but a protective effect is anticipated. In the light of the reassuring data from the DART study, noting that pregnancy as such is a risk factor for severe COVID- 19, and that pregnant women may additionally belong to other risk groups, vaccination may be considered on a case by case basis. Based on biological plausibility no risk in breastfeeding is anticipated. While there was no indication of an excess risk of severe allergic reactions such as anaphylaxis in the clinical study program, three post marketing cases, of which 2 in patients carrying adrenaline pens and one in a person with no known history of allergies, have been reported during vaccination campaigns, and all resolved with standard treatment. Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients is a contraindication. However, there is presently no substantial evidence of a negative benefit/risk balance in a subject with severe allergy to substances absent in the vaccine. For all subjects, the vaccine should be administered in settings where resuscitation facilities are available, as specified in the SmPC and in line with other vaccines. A second dose of the vaccine should not be given to those who have experienced anaphylaxis to the first dose. There are no efficacy data in immunocompromised individuals. Such patients may not be protected as well as immunocompetent individuals by vaccination. While there are limited safety data too in the immunocompromised subjects (a broad and disparate category), no particular safety issues are anticipated, and the benefit/risk balance of vaccination of such subjects is deemed positive, also in light of the underlying excess risk of COVID-19. Studies to monitor potential safety concerns (autoimmune disorders, VAED) are planned. 3.7.2. Balance of benefits and risks Overall, the available data are supportive of a positive B/R in the proposed indication. Assessment report EMA/707383/2020 Page 137/140 3.7.3. Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance Given the emergency situation, it is considered that the identified uncertainties can be addressed post- authorisation in the context of a conditional MA, including further characterisation of the active substance and finished product, the continuation of the pivotal study as long as possible, and post- approval effectiveness studies and routine disease surveillance. Conditional marketing authorisation Efficacy, safety and immunogenicity was demonstrated using clinical batches of vaccine (Process 1). The commercial batches are produced using a different process (Process 2), and the comparability of these processes relies on demonstration of comparable biological, chemical and physical characteristics of the active substance and finished product. The characterisation and control of active substance and finished product are limited in relation to critical quality attributes and impurities. Data demonstrates the presence of truncated/modified forms of mRNA at somewhat higher levels in the batches manufactured with the commercial process as compared to material used in clinical trials. These forms are not sufficiently characteris ed, and although the limited data provided for protein expression does not fully address uncertainties relating to the risk of translating proteins/peptides other than the intended spike protein, the amount of any such proteins, is expected to be too low to elicit an immune response of biological relevance. Indeed, considering the low dose of mRNA (30 µg), the impurities are not considered a safety issue based on general toxicological principles. However, when present in the cell it cannot be excluded that different proteins than the intact full-length spike will be expressed. The risk of unwanted immunological events is considered low based on the following observations and considerations: • Such impurities were present in the vaccine used in the Phase 3 clinical trials with an acceptable safety profile. Although the lack of characterisation hinders a full comparability evaluation there is no indication that there would be important qualitative differences in the nature of these impurities. • The high levels of these impurities reflect the instability of RNA resulting in generation of RNA fragments both in the transcription step and thereafter. Based on electrophoretic data it appears that there is a diverse set of fragments. Although not confirmed, it is unlikely that these RNA molecules to a large extent would be mRNA molecules with intact 5’-cap and 3’-polyA able to be translated into a specific protein or peptide. • The level of any individual fragment of mRNA species would anyway be magnitudes lo wer than the level of the intact mRNA and this would be mirrored by the level of protein expression. The spike protein is a highly immunogenic protein and immunodominance would also ascertain that the immune response to the truncated proteins would be non-significant. Also, lipid related impurities were observed in recently produced finished product batches. Based on the low dose (30 µg mRNA) it is considered that the amounts of these impurities are too low to be of toxicological significance. Regarding the proposed control strategy for active substance and finished product, questions were raised both with regard to the suitability of the test methods used and the acceptance criteria for some tests. Considering the above and the current public health emergency, the characterisation of the active Assessment report EMA/707383/2020 Page 138/140 substance and finished product are considered acceptable, and the proposed specifications for RNA integrity and 5’-Cap are considered to be scientifically justified and acceptable. Nevertheless, additional data to complete the characterisation of the active substance and finished product, and considering clinical experience, are considered important to confirm the adequacy of these specifications, and these data should be provided post-approval as specific obligations to the MA. Therefore, the CHMP considers that the product fulfils the requirements for a conditional marketing authorisation: • The benefit-risk balance is positive, as discussed. • It is likely that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data. Studies are underway to complete the characterisation of the active substance and finished product, and additional clinical data from batches currently in use in ongoing clinical studies, are considered important to confirm the clinical qualification of these specifications. Based upon the applicant’s justification and commitment, detailed plans have been agreed with the applicant and reflected in the quality part of this assessment regarding data to be generated and submitted with interim milestones for assessment by the CHMP in order to complete all proposed specific obligations. Based on the Applicant’s plans and documentation, it is expected that data to fulfil all quality SOs will be submitted gradually between March and July 2021. Furthermore, the applicant will continue the ongoing pivotal Phase 3 randomized, placebo-controlled, observer-blind study C4591001 to obtain 2-year long-term data and to ensure sufficient follow-up in order to confirm the efficacy and safety of Comirnaty. • Unmet medical needs will be addressed There is no approved or widely available COVID-19 vaccine, and COVID-19 remains associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. While care for patients who have COVID-19 has improved over time and with clinical experience, no medications to cure COVID-19 are available and there remains an urgent need for a prophylactic vaccine during the ongoing pandemic. • The benefits to public health of the immediate availability outweigh the risks inherent in the fact that additional data are still required. Convincing efficacy evidence including the elderly and those with comorbid conditions has been provided and long-term effectiveness and safety data will be provided post-authorisation. Taking all this into account, it would not be considered appropriate to withhold a highly beneficial vaccine considering the severity of COVID-19 disease and the current global pandemic situation, since the demonstrated benefits in the current emergency setting clearly outweigh the uncertainties of the available data as outlined above. 3.8. Conclusions The overall benefit/risk balance of Comirnaty is positive. As available data are non-comprehensive, granting of a conditional marketing authorisation is relevant, and in line with provisions of Article 14-a of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 it is supported. Assessment report EMA/707383/2020 Page 139/140 4. Recommendations Outcome Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the benefit-risk balance of Comirnaty is favourable in the following indication: Comirnaty is indicated for active immunisation to prevent COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus, in individuals 16 years of age and older. The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations. The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the conditional marketing authorisation subject to the following conditions and specific obligations: In view of the declared Public Health Emergency of International Concern and in order to ensure early supply this medicinal product is subject to a time-limited exemption allowing reliance on batch control testing conducted in the registered site(s) that are located in a third country. This exemption ceases to be valid on 31 August 2021. Implementation of EU based batch control arrangements, including the necessary variations to the terms of the marketing authorisation, has to be completed by 31 August 2021 at the latest, in line with the agreed plan for this transfer of testing. Progress reports have to be submitted on 31 March 2021 and included in the annual renewal application.

It has been assumed that real effective exchange rates remained constant at their average levels during July 25, 2023–August 22, 2023, except for those currencies participating in the European exchange rate mechanism II, which are assumed to have remained constant in nominal terms relative to the euro; that established policies of national authorities will be maintained (for specific assumptions about fiscal and monetary policies for selected economies, see Box A1 in the Statistical Appendix); that the average price of oil will be $80.49 a barrel in 2023 and $79.92 a barrel in 2024; that the three-month government bond yield for the United States will average 5.3 per cent in 2023 and 5.4 percent in 2024, that for the euro area will average 3.0 percent in 2023 and 3.2 per cent in 2024, and that for Japan will average –0.2 percent in 2023 and –0.1 percent in 2024; and that the 10-year government bond yield for the United States will average 3.8 percent in 2023 and 4.0 per cent in 2024, that for the euro area will average 2.4 percent in 2023 and 2.6 percent in 2024, and that for Japan will average 0.5 per cent in 2023 and 0.6 percent in 2024. These are, of course, working hypotheses rather than forecasts, and the uncertainties surrounding them add to the margin of error that would, in any event, be involved in the projections. The estimates and projections are based on statistical information available through September 25, 2023. The following conventions are used throughout the WEO: • . . . to indicate that data are not available or not applicable; • – betw een years or months (for example, 2022–23 or January–June) to indicate the years or months covered, including the beginning and ending years or months; and • / betw een years or months (for example, 2022/23) to indicate a fiscal or financial year. • “B illion” means a thousand million; “trillion” means a thousand billion. • “B asis points” refers to hundredths of 1 percentage point (for example, 25 basis points are equivalent to ¼ of 1 percentage point). • D ata refer to calendar years, except in the case of a few countries that use fiscal years. Please refer to Table F in the Statistical Appendix, which lists the economies with exceptional reporting periods for national accounts and government finance data for each country. • F or some countries, the figures for 2022 and earlier are based on estimates rather than actual outturns. Please refer to Table G in the Statistical Appendix, which lists the latest actual outturns for the indicators in the national accounts, prices, government finance, and balance of payments for each country. What is new in this publication: • E cuador’s fiscal sector projections, which were previously omitted due to ongoing program discussions, are now included. • E ritrea’s data and projections for 2020–28 are excluded from the database due to constraints in data reporting. • Sri Lanka’s projections for 2023–28 are excluded from publication owing to ongoing discussions on sovereign debt restructuring. • U kraine’s projections for 2024–28, in line with the program’s baseline scenario, are now included. • F or West Bank and Gaza, certain projections for 2022–28 are excluded from publication pending methodological adjustments to statistical series. Assu M pt I ons A nd c onvent I ons In ternational Monetary Fund | October 2023 ix In the tables and figures, the following conventions apply: • T ables and figures in this report that list their source as “IMF staff calculations” or “IMF staff estimates” draw on data from the WEO database. • When countries are not listed alphabetically, they are ordered on the basis of economic size. • M inor discrepancies between sums of constituent figures and totals shown reflect rounding. • Composite data are provided for various groups of countries organized according to economic characteristics or region. Unless noted otherwise, country group composites represent calculations based on 90 percent or more of the weighted group data. • The boundaries, colors, denominations, and any other information shown on maps do not imply, on the part of the IMF , any judgment on the legal status of any territory or any endorsement or acceptance of such boundaries. As used in this report, the terms “country” and “economy” do not in all cases refer to a territorial entity that is a state as understood by international law and practice. As used here, the term also covers some territorial entities that are not states but for which statistical data are maintained on a separate and independent basis. x In ternational Monetary Fund | October 2023 FURTHER INFORMATION Corrections and Revisions The data and analysis appearing in the World Economic Outlook (WEO) are compiled by the IMF staff at the time of publication.

Accompanying the publication on the IMF website is a larger compi- lation of data from the WEO database than is included in the report itself, including files containing the series most frequently requested by readers. These files may be downloaded for use in a variety of software packages. The data appearing in the WEO are compiled by the IMF staff at the time of the WEO exercises. The histori- cal data and projections are based on the information gathered by the IMF country desk officers in the context of their missions to IMF member countries and through their ongoing analysis of the evolving situation in each country. Historical data are updated on a continual basis as more information becomes available, and structural breaks in data are often adjusted to produce smooth series with the use of splicing and other techniques. IMF staff estimates continue to serve as proxies for historical series when complete information is unavailable. As a result, WEO data can differ from those in other sources with official data, including the IMF’s International Financial Statistics. The WEO data and metadata provided are “as is” and “as available,” and every effort is made to ensure their timeliness, accuracy, and completeness, but these cannot be guaranteed.

The survey of prospects and policies is the product of a comprehensive interdepartmental review of world economic developments, which draws primarily on information the IMF staff gathers through its consultations with member countries. These consultations are carried out in particular by the IMF’s area departments—namely, the African Department, Asia and Pacific Department, European Department, Middle East and Central Asia Department, and Western Hemisphere Department— together with the Strategy, Policy, and Review Department; the Monetary and Capital Markets Department; and the Fiscal Affairs Department. The analysis in this report was coordinated in the Research Department under the general direction of Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, Economic Counsellor and Director of Research. The project was directed by Petya Koeva Brooks, Deputy Director, Research Department, and Daniel Leigh, Division Chief, Research Department.

In ternational Monetary Fund | October 2023 xiii FOREWORD Resilient Global Economy Is Limping Along, with Growing Divergences The global economy continues to recover slowly from the blows of the pandemic, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and the cost-of-living crisis. In retrospect, the resilience has been remarkable. Despite the disrup- tion in energy and food markets caused by the war, and the unprecedented tightening of global mon- etary conditions to combat decades-high inflation, the global economy has slowed, but not stalled. Yet growth remains slow and uneven, with growing global divergences. The global economy is limping along, not sprinting. Global activity bottomed out at the end of last year while inflation—both headline and underlying (core)—is gradually being brought under control. But a full recovery toward prepandemic trends appears increasingly out of reach, especially in emerging mar- ket and developing economies. According to our latest projections, global growth will slow from 3.5 percent in 2022 to 3 percent this year and 2.9 percent next year, a 0.1 percentage point downgrade for 2024 from our July projections. This remains well below the historical average. Headline inflation continues to decelerate, from 9.2 percent in 2022, on a year-over-year basis, to 5.9 per- cent this year and 4.8 percent in 2024. Core inflation, excluding food and energy prices, is also projected to decline, albeit more gradually than headline inflation, to 4.5 percent in 2024. As a result, projections are increasingly consistent with a “soft landing” scenario, bringing inflation down without a major downturn in activity, especially in the United States, where the forecast increase in unemploy- ment is very modest, from 3.6 to 3.9 per cent by 2025. But important divergences are appearing. The slowdown is more pronounced in advanced econo- mies than in emerging market and developing ones. Within advanced economies, the US surprised on the upside, with resilient consumption and investment, while euro area activity was revised downward. Many emerging market economies proved quite resilient and surprised on the upside, with the notable exception of China, facing growing headwinds from its real estate crisis and weakening confidence. Three global forces are at play. First, the recovery in services is almost complete. Over the past year, strong demand for services supported service-oriented economies—including important tourism destinations such as France and Spain—relative to manufactur- ing powerhouses such as China and Germany. High demand for labor-intensive services also translated into tighter labor markets, and higher and more persistent services inflation. But services activity is now weaken- ing alongside a persistent manufacturing slowdown, suggesting services inflation will decrease in 2024 and labor markets and activity will soften. Second, part of the slowdown is the result of the tighter monetary policy necessary to bring inflation down. This is starting to bite, but the transmission is uneven across countries. Tighter credit conditions are weighing on housing markets, investment, and activity, more so in countries with a higher share of adjustable-rate mortgages or where households are less willing, or able, to dip into their savings. Firm bank- ruptcies have increased in the US and the euro area, although from historically low levels. Countries are also at different points in their hiking cycles: advanced economies (except Japan) are near the peak, while some emerging market economies, such as Brazil and Chile, have already started easing. Third, inflation and activity are shaped by the incidence of last year’s commodity price shock. Economies heavily dependent on Russian energy imports experienced a steeper increase in energy prices and a sharper slowdown. Some of our recent work shows that the pass-through from higher energy prices played a large role in driving core inflation upward in the euro area, unlike in the United States, where core inflation pressures reflect instead a tight labor market. Despite signs of softening, labor markets in advanced economies remain buoyant, with historically low unem- ployment rates helping to support activity. So far, there is scant evidence of a “wage-price spiral,” and real wages remain below prepandemic levels. Further, many coun- tries experienced a sharp—and welcome—compression in the wage distribution. Some of this compression reflects the higher amenity value of flexible and remote work schedules for high earners, reducing wage pres- sures for that group. Risks While some of the extreme risks—such as severe banking instability—have moderated since April, the balance remains tilted to the downside. First, the real estate crisis could deepen further in China, an important risk for the global economy. The policy challenge is complex. Restoring confidence requires promptly restructuring struggling property developers, preserving financial stability, and address- ing the strains in local public finance. If real estate prices decline too rapidly, the balance sheets of banks and households will worsen, with the potential for serious financial amplification. If real estate prices are artificially propped up, balance sheets will be protected for a while, but this may crowd out other investment opportunities, reduce new construction activity, and have an adverse impact on local govern- ment revenues through reduced land sales. Either way, China’s economy needs to pivot away from a credit- driven real estate model of growth. Second, commodity prices could become more vol- atile under renewed geopolitical tensions and disrup- tions linked to climate change. Since June, oil prices have increased by about 25 percent, on the back of extended supply cuts from OPEC+ (the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries plus selected nonmembers) countries. Food prices remain elevated and could be disrupted further by an escalation of the war in Ukraine, causing important hardship for many low-income countries. This, of course, represents a serious risk to the disinflation strategy. Geoeconomic fragmentation has also led to a sharp increase in the dispersion in commodity prices across regions, including critical minerals. As Chapter 3 of this report analyzes, this could pose serious macroeconomic risks going forward, including to the climate transition. Third, while both underlying and headline infla- tion have decreased, they remain uncomfortably high. Near-term inflation expectations have risen markedly above target, although they now appear to be turning a corner. As Chapter 2 of this report details, bringing these near-term inflation expecta- tions back down is critical to winning the battle against inflation. With tight labor markets, ample excess savings in some countries, and adverse energy price developments, inflation could become more entrenched, requiring even more forceful action from central banks. Fourth, fiscal buffers have eroded in many coun- tries, with elevated debt levels, rising funding costs, slowing growth, and an increasing mismatch between the growing demands on the state and available fiscal resources (see the October 2023 Fiscal Monitor). This leaves many countries more vulnerable to crises and demands a renewed focus on managing fiscal risks. Finally, despite the tightening of monetary policy, financial conditions have eased in many countries (see the October 2023 Global Financial Stability Report). The danger is of a sharp repricing of risk, especially for emerging markets, that would appreciate further the US dollar, trigger capital outflows, and increase borrowing costs and debt distress. Policies Under our baseline scenario, inflation continues to recede as central banks maintain a tight stance. With many countries near the peak of their tightening cycles, little additional tightening is warranted. How- ever, easing prematurely would squander the gains achieved in the past 18 months. Once the disinflation process is firmly on its way and near-term inflation expectations are decreasing, adjusting the policy rate downward will allow the monetary policy stance, that is, the real interest rate, to remain unchanged until inflation targets are in sight. Fiscal policy needs to support the monetary strategy and help the disinflation process. In 2022, fiscal and monetary policies were pulling in the same direction, as many of the pandemic emergency fiscal measures were unwound. In 2023, the degree of alignment has decreased. Most worrying is the case of the United States, where the fiscal stance has deteriorated substan- tially. Fiscal policy in the US should not be procycli- cal, even less so at this stage of the inflation cycle. More broadly, fiscal policy everywhere should focus on rebuilding fiscal buffers that have been severely eroded by the pandemic and the energy crisis, for instance, by removing energy subsidies. We should also return our focus to the medium term. Here the picture is becoming darker. Medium- term growth prospects are weak, especially for emerging market and developing economies. The implications are profound: a much slower WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: NAVIGATING GLOBAL DIVERGENCES xiv In ternational Monetary Fund | October 2023 convergence toward the living standards of advanced economies, reduced fiscal space, increased debt vulnerabilities and exposure to shocks, and dimin- ished opportunities to overcome the scarring from the pandemic and the war. With lower growth, higher interest rates, and reduced fiscal space, structural reforms become key. Higher long-term growth can be achieved through a careful sequence of structural reforms, especially those focused on governance, business regulations, and the external sector. These “first-generation” reforms help unlock growth and make subsequent reforms— whether to credit markets, or for the green transi- tion—much more effective. Multilateral cooperation can help ensure that all countries achieve better growth outcomes. First, countries should avoid implementing policies that contravene World T rade Organization rules and distort international trade. Second, countries should safeguard the flow of critical minerals needed for the climate transition, as well as that of agricultural com- modities. Such “green corridors” would help reduce volatility and accelerate the green transition. Finally, all countries should aim to limit geoeco- nomic fragmentation that prevents joint progress toward common goals and instead work toward restoring trust in rules-based multilateral frameworks that enhance transparency and policy certainty and help foster a shared global prosperity. A robust global financial safety net with a well-resourced IMF at its center is essential. Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas Economic Counsellor F o R e Wo R d In ternational Monetary Fund | October 2023 xv xvi In ternational Monetary Fund | October 2023 The global recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine remains slow and uneven. Despite economic resilience earlier this year, with a reopening rebound and progress in reduc- ing inflation from last year’s peaks, it is too soon to take comfort. Economic activity still falls short of its prepandemic path, especially in emerging market and developing economies, and there are widening diver- gences among regions. Several forces are holding back the recovery. Some reflect the long-term consequences of the pandemic, the war in Ukraine, and increasing geoeconomic fragmentation. Others are more cyclical in nature, including the effects of monetary policy tight- ening necessary to reduce inflation, withdrawal of fiscal support amid high debt, and extreme weather events. Global growth is forecast to slow from 3.5 percent in 2022 to 3.0 percent in 2023 and 2.9 percent in 2024. The projections remain below the historical (2000–19) average of 3.8 percent, and the forecast for 2024 is down by 0.1 percentage point from the July 2023 Update to the World Economic Outlook. For advanced economies, the expected slowdown is from 2.6 percent in 2022 to 1.5 percent in 2023 and 1.4 per cent in 2024, amid stronger-than-expected US momentum but weaker-than-expected growth in the euro area. Emerg- ing market and developing economies are projected to have growth modestly decline, from 4.1 percent in 2022 to 4.0 percent in both 2023 and 2024, with a down- ward revision of 0.1 percentage point in 2024, reflecting the property sector crisis in China. Forecasts for global growth over the medium term, at 3.1 per cent, are at their lowest in decades, and prospects for countries to catch up to higher living standards are weak. Global inflation is forecast to decline steadily, from 8.7 percent in 2022 to 6.9 per cent in 2023 and 5.8 percent in 2024. But the forecasts for 2023 and 2024 are revised up by 0.1 per centage point and 0.6 percentage point, respectively, and inflation is not expected to return to target until 2025 in most cases. Risks to the outlook are more balanced than they were six months ago, on account of the resolution of US debt ceiling tensions and Swiss and US authorities’ having acted decisively to contain financial turbulence. The likelihood of a hard landing has receded, but the balance of risks to global growth remains tilted to the downside. China’s property sector crisis could deepen, with global spillovers, particularly for com- modity exporters. Elsewhere, as Chapter 2 explains, near-term inflation expectations have risen and could contribute—along with tight labor markets––to core inflation pressures persisting and requiring higher policy rates than expected. More climate and geopoliti- cal shocks could cause additional food and energy price spikes. As Chapter 3 explains, intensifying geoeconomic fragmentation could constrain the flow of commodities across markets, causing additional price volatility and complicating the green transition. Amid rising debt- service costs, more than half of low-income developing countries are in or at high risk of debt distress. There is little margin for error on the policy front. Central banks need to restore price stability while using policy tools to relieve potential financial stress when needed. As Chapter 2 explains, effective mon- etary policy frameworks and communication are vital for anchoring expectations and minimizing the output costs of disinflation. Fiscal policymakers should rebuild budgetary room for maneuver and withdraw untargeted measures while protecting the vulner- able. Reforms to reduce structural impediments to growth––by, among other things, encouraging labor market participation—would smooth the decline of inflation to target and facilitate debt reduction. Faster and more efficient multilateral coordination is needed on debt resolution to avoid debt distress. Coopera- tion is needed as well to mitigate the effects of climate change and speed the green transition, including (as Chapter 3 explains) by ensuring steady cross-border flows of the necessary minerals. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY International Monetary Fund | October 2023 1 Growing Global Divergences More than three years after the global economy suf- fered the largest shock of the past 75 years, the wounds are still healing, amid widening growth divergences across regions. After a strong initial rebound from the depths of the COVID-19 pandemic, the pace of recov- ery has moderated. Several forces are holding back the recovery. Some reflect the long-term consequences of the pandemic, Russia’s war in Ukraine, and increasing geoeconomic fragmentation. Others are more cyclical, including the effects of monetary policy tightening necessary to reduce inflation, withdrawal of fiscal sup- port amid high debt, and extreme weather events. Despite signs of economic resilience earlier this year and progress in reducing headline inflation, economic activity is still generally falling short of prepandemic (January 2020) projections, especially in emerging mar ket and developing economies (Figure 1.1, panel 1). The strongest recovery among major economies has been in the United States, where GDP in 2023 is esti- mated to exceed its prepandemic path. The euro area has recovered, though less strongly—with output still 2.2 per cent below prepandemic projections, reflecting greater exposure to the war in Ukraine and the associ- ated adverse terms-of-trade shock, as well as a spike in imported energy prices. In China, the pandemic-related slowdown in 2022 and the property sector crisis con- tribute to the larger output losses of about 4.2 per cent, compared with prepandemic predictions. Other emerging market and developing economies have seen even weaker recoveries, especially low-income countries, where output losses average more than 6.5 per cent. Higher interest rates and depreciated currencies have exacerbated the difficulties of low-income countries, placing more than half either at high risk of distress or already in distress. Overall, global output for 2023 is estimated at 3.4 per cent (or about $3.6 trillion in 2023 prices) below prepandemic projections. Private consumption has also recovered faster in advanced economies than in emerging market and developing economies, owing to an earlier reopening in the former group facilitated by greater availability of effective vaccines, stronger safety nets, more ample policy stimulus, and greater feasibility of remote work. These factors supported livelihoods during the pandemic, and household consumption is now broadly back to prepandemic trends. Among advanced economies, private consumption has been stron- ger in the United States than in the euro area, with households receiving larger fiscal transfers early in the pandemic and spending the associated savings more quickly; being better insulated from the rise in energy prices resulting from the war in Ukraine; and feeling relatively confident amid historically tight US labor markets, which have supported real disposable incomes (Figure 1.1, panel 2). Among emerging market and developing economies, the consumption shortfall is particularly large in China, reflecting tight restrictions on mobility during the COVID-19 crisis. Divergences in labor market performance across regions broadly mirror those for output and consump- tion. Employment and labor participation rates are estimated to exceed prepandemic trends in advanced economies but to remain significantly below them in emerging market and developing economies, reflect- ing more severe output losses and much weaker social protection. Countries that had the most limited fiscal space are also those where employment shortfalls are the largest (ILO 2023). Among advanced economies, the euro area has seen larger employment gains than the United States. This may reflect more extensive use in the former of worker-retention programs modeled on the German Kurzarbeit short-time work scheme (IMF 2020), which protect workers’ income and allow businesses to retain firm-specific human capital, reducing the costly process of separation, rehiring, and training. In the euro area, these programs bolstered employment during the most challenging phases of the crisis and accelerated the recovery when economies reopened (Figure 1.1, panel 3). Investment, on the other hand, has uniformly fallen short of prepandemic trends across regions. Businesses have shown less enthusiasm for expansion and risk taking amid rising interest rates, withdrawal of fiscal support, dimmer prospects for product demand, stricter lending conditions, and growing uncertainties GLOBAL PROSPECTS AND POLICIES 1 CHAPTER WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: Nav I g a T IN g gLO b a L D I v E R g E NCE s 2 In ternational Monetary Fund | October 2023 regarding geoeconomic fragmentation. Higher leverage has further dampened investment (see Chapter 2 of the April 2022 World Economic Outlook [WEO]), which remains 3 per cent to 10 percent lower across regions than had been projected before the pandemic (Figure 1.1, panel 2). Moreover, the pandemic, war in Ukraine, and wors- ening climate shocks have contributed to a reversal in decades-long poverty reduction trends. According to World Bank staff estimates (Mahler and others 2022), 75 million to 95 million more people were living in extreme poverty in 2022 compared with prepandemic estimates. Spikes in food prices and related insecurities following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, as well as bouts of extreme weather, have accentuated these difficulties. The global average temperature in July 2023 was the highest on record for any month, amid reports of cat- astrophic flooding, heat waves, and wildfires in many regions. Overall, the global prevalence of undernour- ishment is significantly higher than before the pan- demic (FAO and others 2023). Resilient Start to 2023, Signs of Slowdown Despite these persistent challenges, several head- winds to global growth subsided earlier this year. The World Health Organization announced in May that it no longer considered COVID-19 a global health emergency, and infections and hospitalizations appear to remain relatively limited, despite a recent uptick in some regions. Supply chains, which the pandemic disrupted, have largely normalized, with shipping costs and suppliers’ delivery times back to prepandemic lev- els (Figure 1.2). And global financial conditions eased after Swiss and US authorities took strong action in March to contain turbulence in their banking sectors. Amid these conditions, global GDP expanded by 3.4 per cent in the second quarter of 2023 compared Employment Participation Private consumption Capital formation Figure 1.1.

The resilience reflected strong consumption amid tight labor markets in the United States and robust activity in economies with large travel and tourism sectors, such as Italy, Mexico, and Spain. These developments offset a slowdown in more interest-rate-sensitive manufacturing sectors. That said, there are signs the rebound is fading: • Diminishing pandemic-era savings: The stock of savings built during the pandemic, which has so far supported consumers, is declining in advanced economies, especially the United States, as illus- trated in Figure 1.3.1 This implies fewer resources for households to draw on as they contend with a still-elevated cost of living and more restricted credit availability in the context of monetary tightening aimed at reducing inflation. • S lowing catch-up in services, including travel: Interna- tional tourist arrivals are approaching prepandemic levels in most regions (Figure 1.4, panel 1). The recovery of travel during 2021–23 has come with especially strong economic growth in economies with a large share of tourism activities in GDP 1Estimates of the stock of excess household savings—the cumu- lation of saving beyond the prepandemic trend—come with a range of uncertainty and can differ across methodological approaches. For the United States, they generally show a consistent pattern, with the stock declining (see, for example, Abdelrahman and Oliveira 2023). (Figure 1.4, panel 2). These economies had suffered especially sharp contractions in GDP at the onset of the pandemic (Milesi-Ferretti 2021). But with the recovery in tourism maturing, the boost to growth is waning. 2 Leading indicators for services now indi- cate weaker growth or declining output (Figure 1.5, panel 2) in economies that previously enjoyed a strong rebound. • P ersistent manufacturing slowdown: Recent data releases point to a wide-ranging slowdown or con- traction in the manufacturing sector, with related declines in industrial production, investment, and international trade in goods. This weakness reflects 2A tourism share that is higher by 10 per centage points of GDP comes with cumulative growth that is higher by 12 per centage points in 2021–23 (Figure 1.4, panel 2), but for 2023 alone, the relation- ship is less than half as strong.

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: Nav I g a T IN g gLO b a L D I v E R g E NCE s 4 In ternational Monetary Fund | October 2023 the combined effects of the postpandemic shift in consumption back toward services, weaker demand stemming from a higher cost of living, the unwind- ing of crisis policy support, tighter credit conditions, and general uncertainty amid intensified geoeco- nomic fragmentation (Figure 1.5, panel 1). Part of the slowdown is policy induced––the result of the globally synchronous central bank tighten- ing of monetary conditions to restore price stability. Signs that tightening efforts are paying off are increas- ingly apparent, with global inflation steadily declining from its multidecade peak in 2022 amid tighter credit availability and cooling housing markets. Part of the slowdown also reflects more idiosyncratic develop- ments, such as the property sector crisis in China. China: Slower Growth China’s growth momentum is fading following a COVID-19 reopening surge in early 2023. Growth slowed from 8.9 percent in the first quarter of 2023 (seasonally adjusted annualized quarterly rate) to 4.0 per cent in the second quarter. With ample eco- nomic slack and declining energy and food prices, inflation fell to an estimated 0.2 per cent (year over year) in the second quarter of 2023. High-frequency indicators suggest further weakness with the property sector crisis in the country leading the factors hampering growth. Country Garden— China’s largest property developer and a major benefi- ciary of government support—is facing severe liquidity stress, a sign that real estate distress is spreading to stronger developers, despite policy easing measures. Property developers face severe funding constraints, preventing them from completing presold homes. This is undermining home buyer confidence and prolonging the property sector downturn. Meanwhile, real estate investment and housing prices continue to decline, putting pressure on local governments’ revenues from land sales and threatening already fragile public finances ( F igure 1.6, panel 1). These developments, together with labor market uncertainty—as reflected in elevated youth unemploy- ment that reached more than 20 per cent in June 2023 (Figure 1.6, panel 2)—have weighed on consumption. Consumer confidence remains subdued despite the economy’s reopening in the first quarter. Industrial production, business investment, and exports are also weakening, reflecting a combination of waning foreign demand and geopolitical uncertainty. Commodity exporters and countries that are part of the Asian industrial supply chain are the most exposed to China’s loss of momentum.

CHAPTER 1 gLO ba L P RO s PECT s a ND P OLICIE s 5International Monetary Fund | October 2023 in the second quarter of 2023. About four-fifths of the gap between the 2022 peak and the prepandemic (2017–19) annual average level of 3.5 per cent has closed. Among major economies, headline inflation in the second quarter of 2023 ranged from –0.1 per cent in China (at a quarterly annualized rate) to 2.8 percent in the euro area and 2.7 per cent in the United States (Figure 1.7). A narrowing in the cross-country varia- tion in headline inflation has accompanied the decline. As Figure 1.8 reports, the international distribution of inflation rates widened during the 2022 inflation surge, becoming skewed upward, but has since begun to normalize. A fall in energy prices and—to a lesser extent––in food prices has driven the decline in headline inflation. As the Commodity Special Feature in this chapter reports, notwithstanding a rebound in July, crude oil prices have declined during 2023 and are well below their June 2022 peak, on the back of lower global demand partly driven by tighter global monetary policy affecting activity. Supply curbs by OPEC+ (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries plus selected nonmember countries) were partly offset by strong oil output growth in non-OPEC countries, most notably the United States. Natural gas prices also remain well below their 2022 peak, reflecting ample storage and supplies from Norway and north- ern Africa. Food prices have declined modestly in 2023, with lower demand offset by supply reductions, notably those resulting from Russia’s withdrawal from the Black Sea Grain Initiative in July, which reduced the supply of wheat to the global market. The normal- ization of supply chains has further contributed to the decline in headline inflation in most countries. Underlying (core) inflation has also declined, but more gradually.

Among major economies, in the second quarter of 2023, it ranged from 0.3 per cent in China (at a quarterly annualized rate) to 4.6 per cent in the euro area and 4.7 per cent in the United States. Data for July indicate a rise in inflation excluding food and energy in most advanced economies; more data releases are needed to assess progress in reducing underly- ing inflation. The drivers of core inflation have reflected a combi- nation of demand pressures, as shown in labor market conditions and pass-through effects from past shocks to headline inflation shocks, including those arising from supply shifts in various industries. The roles of these factors have differed markedly across economies. Demand pressures in some advanced economies arose from significant COVID-19–era fiscal payments to households, as well as from ample monetary policy stimulus early in the pandemic, which supported the recovery in consumer spending. These policy-induced pressures declined as policy support subsided. Pass-through effects include the effects of past relative price shocks—notably those to the price of energy— on prices and costs in other industries through supply chain inputs and wage demands. An important pass-through channel is, as Chapter 2 explains, the rise in near-term inflation expectations, which has implications for both wage and price setting. IMF staff analysis (Figure 1.9) suggests that in the euro area and the United Kingdom, pass-through from past relative price movements––in particular that from energy price shocks associated with external factors––has recently played a larger role than in the United States in driving core inflation (the staff’s methodology was the same as that used in Dao and others 2023). In the United States, labor market tightness has been an especially strong driver. Although labor markets remain tight, especially in the United States, the recent decline in the ratio of vacancies to the number of unemployed people suggests some easing ( F igure 1.10). Wage growth has remained contained, with wage-price spirals—in which prices and wages accelerate together for a sustained period—not gener- ally taking hold in advanced economies ( F igure 1.11). A t the same time, evidence shows that wages at the bottom of the distribution have risen faster than the average, compressing the wage distribution. Longer-term inflation expectations have remained well anchored and contributed little to recent movements in core inflation (Figure 1.9; Chapter 2). Company profits have increased robustly over the past two years, with wages having risen more slowly than prices (Figure 1.12). For the United States and the euro area, a decomposition of the GDP deflator into labor costs and profits shows that in the early phase of the pandemic (2020–21), profits accounted for most of the rise in prices. But since 2022, labor costs have contributed an increasing share to rising prices—particularly in the United States. The rise in profits (sales revenue minus all costs) does not necessarily signal increased monopoly power, with firms deliberately limiting supplies to raise prices in excess of the cost of producing an additional unit of output (marginal cost). Profits can rise when a surge Figure 1.8.

CHAPTER 1 gLO ba L P RO s PECT s a ND P OLICIE s 7International Monetary Fund | October 2023 in demand meets supply constraints or when sup- ply constraints tighten, implying higher prices, and wages do not immediately adjust. As wages start to rise, profits can be expected to erode. Accordingly, IMF staff analysis based on firm-level data indicates little change in firms’ markups (prices in excess of marginal cost) across various sectors in major advanced economies during 2019–22. 3 Similarly, Colonna, T orrini, and Viviano (2023) conclude that despite profit share increases, firm markups were unchanged or declined across several sectors in Germany and Italy during 2022. Overall, these results suggest that a rise in market power did not significantly contrib- ute to the inflation surge of 2022. Moreover, there is some evidence that since 2022, rising labor costs have accounted for a significantly larger share of US price increases than profits. Even as central banks have taken decisive action, inflation remains above target in almost all economies with an inflation target. Among major central banks 3The IMF staff’s methodology is that illustrated in Box 1.2 of the October 2022 World Economic Outlook. The “economic markup” (a pr oducer’s price over true marginal costs, inclusive of the shadow cost of supply constraints) may be constant even while accounting profits (total revenue minus costs) may show an increase. If supply constraints remain, and nominal wages start to rise, prices could then remain unchanged, with the true markup remaining constant but accounting profits declining.

The Bank of Japan has continued with monetary easing but in July decided to allow more flexibility in the conduct of yield curve control such that the 10-year yield can now rise up to 1 percent. The largest exception to this pattern is China, where headline inflation is subdued and below the authorities’ target and the People’s Bank of China reduced interest rates in June and August. Tighter Monetary Policy, Tighter Credit Acute stress in the banking sector has receded. The March 2023 banking scare remained contained and limited to problematic regional banks in the United States and Credit Suisse––a Swiss globally systemically important bank––on account of swift reaction by authorities in both countries. However, rapid rate hikes in major advanced economies over the past 18 months, a necessary response to rapidly rising inflationary pressures, have resulted in a tight monetary policy stance—real rates above neutral rates—that is expected to endure well into 2025 (Figure 1.13). And signs are that tighter monetary policy has started to work its way through the finan- cial system.

And there are also clear signs that tighter credit conditions are increasingly affecting real activity. In advanced econ- omies, credit and investment demand contracted in the first half of the year, reflecting tighter supply as well as lower demand for credit, as many businesses began to deleverage in response to higher interest rates and production overcapacity (Figure 1.14). Higher interest rates are likely to put banks under increasing pressure in major economies, both directly (through higher cost of funding) and indirectly (as credit quality deteriorates). Housing markets have already been reacting, with house prices slowing or reversing since the beginning of the tightening cycle in several countries (Figure 1.15), and bankruptcy rates have increased in some economies (increasing by 20 percent in the United States over the last year) as pandemic-time forbearance measures are phased out. Bankruptcies remain lower than before the pandemic in most countries but are rising rapidly. Debt markets have started to reflect tighter mon- etary policy, whereas spreads to risk-free government debt have stayed more or less constant. This suggests that although credit conditions have tightened significantly, there is no immediate indication of a credit crunch. United States United Kingdom Euro area Figure 1.13.

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: Nav I g a T IN g gLO b a L D I v E R g E NCE s 10 In ternational Monetary Fund | October 2023 Outlook: Stable but Slow The latest projections confirm that the global economy is slowing as inflation declines from last year’s multidecade peak. A contraction in global per capita real GDP—which often happens in a global recession—is not part of the baseline scenario. Growth and employment in the first half of the year remained more resilient than forecast in the April 2023 WEO. Although there is little change in the forecast for the global average since the July 2023 WEO Update, several shifts in growth and inflation prospects are observed across countries. In addition, medium-term prospects for economic growth remain the lowest in decades, with middle- and lower-income countries facing a slower pace of convergence toward higher living standards. The baseline forecasts for the global economy are predicated on a number of assumptions (Figure 1.16), notably for fuel and nonfuel commodity prices, as well as the stances of monetary and fiscal policy: • Commodity price assumptions: Prices of fuel com- modities are projected to fall on average by 36 per - cent and oil prices by about 17 per cent, with the decreases reflecting mainly the slowdown in global economic activity, and natural gas and coal prices to decline from their 2022 peaks by 61 per cent and 51 per cent, respectively. The forecast for non- fuel commodity prices is a decline of 6.3 per cent, on average, in 2023, with prices for base metals expected to decrease by 4.7 per cent, the decreases reflecting concerns regarding real estate investment in China. Food commodity prices, after rising by 14.8 per cent in 2022, are predicted to decline by 6.8 per cent in 2023, with prices remaining well above their 2021 levels. Compared with forecasts in the July 2023 WEO Update, an upward revision to wheat prices following the suspension of the Black Sea Grain Initiative (which occurred after the July 2023 WEO Update forecasting round) is broadly offset by downward revisions to other food commodity prices. • M onetary policy assumptions: Global interest rate assumptions are on average revised upward compar ed with those in the April 2023 WEO, reflecting actual and signaled policy tightening by major central banks. The Federal Reserve’s policy rate is expected to peak at its current level of about 5.4 per cent, the Bank of England to raise its to peak at about 6.0 per cent, and the European Central Bank to raise its to peak at 3.9 per cent in 2023, before all three reduce rates in 2024. The higher policy path over the longer term has contributed to the rise in long-term policy rate assumptions.

CHAPTER 1 gLO ba L P RO s PECT s a ND P OLICIE s 11International Monetary Fund | October 2023 upward, reflecting changes to the country’s yield-curve-control framework, and long-term rates are revised upward accordingly. As near-term inflation expectations decline, real interest rates are likely to stay elevated even after nominal rates start to fall. In addition, changes in monetary policy are becoming less synchronous, with some central banks that tightened policy earlier (such as the Central Bank of Brazil) initiating their easing cycle. • F iscal policy assumptions: Governments in advanced economies are on average expected to ease fiscal policy in 2023, following a rise in fiscal balances in 2022, whereas in emerging market and developing economies, the projected fiscal stance is on average neutral. Fiscal consolidation is expected in 2024 in both groups of economies. Fiscal tightening is on average expected to be greater in economies that recently experienced a sharper rise in government debt (Figure 1.16, panel 3). A rise in government debt amounting to 10 per centage points of GDP during 2019–22 is associated on average with fiscal consolidation (rise in the structural primary balance) of 0.8 per centage point of GDP during 2022–24. Exceptions to this pattern include, for example, Argentina, where despite a decline, debt levels remain high, and the fiscal stance is expected to continue tightening to secure fiscal and debt sustainability. Growth Outlook: Offsetting Divergences Global growth is projected to fall from 3.5 per cent in 2022 to 3.0 per cent in 2023 and 2.9 per cent in 2024 on an annual average basis (Table 1.1). There is a downward revision of 0.1 per centage point for 2024 compared with the July 2023 WEO Update projection. At the same time, there are more sizable changes in the underlying growth trajectories of major economies, with stronger projections for the United States and downward revisions for China and the euro area. The forecasts for growth during 2023–24 are also slower than those before the onset of the shocks of 2020–22 (Figure 1.17): the January 2022 WEO Update projected global growth at 3.8 per cent in 2023 and 3.4 per cent in 2024. The 2023–24 forecasts are also below the historical (2000–19) annual average of 3.8 per cent. Growth is below the historical average across broad income groups, both in overall GDP as well as in per capita GDP . On a year-over-year basis, global growth bottomed out in the fourth quarter of 2022. However, in some major economies, it is not expected to have bottomed out until the second half of 2023. Advanced economies continue to drive the decline in annual average growth from 2022 to 2023, with stronger services activity offset by weaker manufactur- ing, as well as idiosyncratic factors. On average, these economies are expected to have broadly stable growth in 2024 with a pickup in 2025. By contrast, emerging market and developing economies, on average, are projected to see stable growth over 2022–24, with a slight pickup in 2025, although with sizable shifts across regions. Growth Forecast for Advanced Economies For advanced economies, the growth slowdown projected is significant—from 2.6 per cent in 2022 to 1.5 per cent in 2023 and 1.4 per cent in 2024—with no overall revision from the July 2023 WEO Update, amid stronger-than-expected US momentum and weaker-than-expected growth in the euro area. About 90 per cent of advanced economies are projected to see lower growth in 2023. With the projected slow- down in advanced economies, annual unemployment is projected to rise by an average of 0.1 percentage point over 2022–24, although with more pronounced World Advanced economies Emerging market and developing economies Figure 1.17.

Neverthe- less, the forecast for unemployment in 2024 is on average 0.4 per centage point lower than that in the April 2 023 WEO, reflecting still-tight labor markets in a number of cases. • I n the United States, growth is projected at 2.1 per - cent in 2023 and 1.5 per cent in 2024. The forecast is revised upward by 0.3 per centage point for 2023 and by 0.5 per centage point for 2024, compared with July 2023 WEO Update projections, owing to stronger business investment in the second quarter and resilient consumption growth, a reflection of a still-tight labor market. In addition, as already mentioned, the general government fiscal stance is expected to be expansionary in 2023. However, with wage growth slowing, savings accumulated during the pandemic running out, and the Federal Reserve maintaining tight monetary policy, growth is expected to slow in the second half of 2023 and in 2024. The unemployment rate is forecast to rise from 3.6 per cent in the second quarter of 2023 to a peak of 4.0 per cent by the last quarter of 2024––a lower peak than previously projected (5.2 per cent in the April 2023 WEO and 5.6 per cent at the time of the October 2022 WEO), consistent with a softer landing than earlier expected for the US economy. • G rowth in the euro area is projected to fall from 3.3 per cent in 2022 to 0.7 per cent in 2023, before rising to 1.2 percent in 2024. The forecast is revised downward by 0.2 per centage point and 0.3 per - centage point for 2023 and 2024, respectively, compared with July 2023 WEO Update projections. There is also a divergence in growth across major euro area economies in 2023. For Germany, where a slight economic contraction is now projected in the second half of 2023, amid weakness in inter- est-rate-sensitive sectors and slower trading-partner demand, there is a downward revision of 0.2 per - centage point to growth of –0.5 per cent. For France, where there was catch-up in industrial production and external demand outperformed in the first half of 2023, there is an upward 0.2 per centage point revision to growth of 1.0 per cent. • Among other major advanced economies, there is also some divergence in growth. Growth in the United Kingdom is projected to decline from 4.1 per cent in 2022 to 0.5 per cent in 2023, with a 0.1 per centage point upward revision. The decline in growth reflects tighter monetary policies to curb still-high inflation and lingering impacts of the terms-of-trade shock from high energy prices. In Japan, growth is projected to rise from 1.0 per cent in 2022 to 2.0 per cent in 2023, with a 0.6 per centage point upward revision, buoyed by pent-up demand, a surge in inbound tourism, and accommodative policies, as well as by a rebound in auto exports that had earlier been held back by supply chain issues.

CHAPTER 1 gLO ba L P RO s PECT s a ND P OLICIE s 15International Monetary Fund | October 2023 Growth Forecast for Emerging Market and Developing Economies For emerging market and developing economies, growth is projected to decline relatively modestly, from 4.1 per cent in 2022 to 4.0 per cent in both 2023 and 2024, with a downward revision of 0.1 percentage point for 2024 compared with the July 2023 WEO Update projection. However, this average path hides regional divergences, with growth in two of the five main geographic regions rising in 2023 and then falling in 2024. • G rowth in emerging and developing Asia is projected to rise from 4.5 percent in 2022 to 5.2 percent in 2023, then to decline to 4.8 percent in 2024, with downward revisions of 0.1 percentage point and 0.2 per centage point for 2023 and 2024, respectively, compared with July projections. The revision reflects a lower forecast for China, which is revised downward by 0.2 percentage point for 2023 and by 0.3 percent- age point for 2024 to growth of 5.0 per cent in 2023 and 4.2 percent in 2024. With the property market crisis in that country, lower investment is the main contributor to the revision. Growth in India is pro- jected to remain strong, at 6.3 percent in both 2023 and 2024, with an upward revision of 0.2 percentage point for 2023, reflecting stronger-than-expected consumption during April-June. • G rowth in emerging and developing Europe is projected to rise to 2.4 percent in 2023, with an upward revision of 0.6 percentage point since July, before declining to 2.2 percent in 2024. The forecast for Russia is for a rise from –2.1 percent in 2022 to 2.2 percent in 2023, with an upward revision of 0.7 percentage point for 2023. The rise in growth reflects a substantial fiscal stimulus, strong investment, and resilient consumption in the context of a tight labor market. The upward revision for the region for 2023 also reflects an increase of 5.0 percentage points to the forecast for Ukraine to growth of 2.0 percent; the increase is due to stronger-than-expected domestic demand growth, with firms and households adapting to the war in that country amid sharply declining inflation and stable foreign exchange markets. It additionally reflects a 1.0 per centage point upside revision to growth of 4.0 percent in Türkiye, on the back of stronger-than-expected domestic demand. • Latin America and the Caribbean is expected to see growth decline from 4.1 percent in 2022 to 2.3 per cent in both 2023 and 2024, although with 0.4 percentage point and 0.1 percentage point upward revisions for 2023 and 2024, respectively, since July. The decline for 2023 reflects a normalization of growth along with the effect of tighter policies, a weaker external environment, and lower commodity prices. The upward revision to 2023 since July reflects stronger-than-expected growth in Brazil, revised upward by 1.0 percentage point to 3.1 per cent, driven by buoyant agriculture and resilient services in the first half of 2023. Consumption has also remained strong, supported by fiscal stimulus. The upward revi- sion for the region also reflects stronger-than-expected growth in Mexico, revised upward by 0.6 percentage point to 3.2 percent, with the delayed postpandemic recovery taking hold in construction and services and spillovers from resilient US demand. • G rowth in the Middle East and Central Asia is projected to decline from 5.6 percent in 2022 to 2.0 per cent in 2023, before picking up to 3.4 per- cent in 2024, with a 0.5 percentage point downward revision for 2023 and a 0.2 percentage point upward revision for 2024. The change for 2023 is attribut- able mainly to a steeper-than-expected growth slow- down in Saudi Arabia, from 8.7 percent in 2022 to 0.8 percent in 2023, with a negative revision to the latter of 1.1 percentage point. The downgrade for growth in Saudi Arabia in 2023 reflects announced production cuts, including unilateral cuts and those in line with an agreement through OPEC+. Private investment, including that from “gigaproj- ect” implementation, continues to support non-oil GDP growth, which remains strong and unchanged from previous projections. The downgrade for 2023 also reflects cuts to the growth forecast for Sudan to about –18.3 percent (a downward revision of nearly 20 percentage points) reflecting the outbreak of conflict, deteriorating domestic security, and the worsening humanitarian situation. The upgrade for 2024 reflects the unwinding of some of the announced production cuts. • In sub-Saharan Africa, growth is projected to decline to 3.3 percent in 2023 before picking up to 4.0 percent in 2024, with 0.2 percentage point and 0.1 percentage point downward revisions for 2023 and 2024, respectively, and with growth remaining below the historical average of 4.8 percent. The projected decline reflects, in a number of cases, worsening weather shocks, the global slowdown, and domestic supply issues, including, notably, in the electricity sector. Growth in Nigeria is projected WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: Nav I g a T IN g gLO b a L D I v E R g E NCE s 16 In ternational Monetary Fund | October 2023 to decline from 3.3 percent in 2022 to 2.9 percent in 2023 and 3.1 percent in 2024, with negative effects of high inflation on consumption taking hold. The forecast for 2023 is revised downward by 0.3 percentage point, reflecting weaker oil and gas production than expected, partially as a result of maintenance work. In South Africa, growth is expected to decline from 1.9 percent in 2022 to 0.9 per cent in 2023, with the decline reflecting power shortages, although with a 0.6 percentage point upward revision thanks to the intensity of power shortages in the second quarter of 2023 being lower than expected. Inflation Outlook: Gradual Decline to Target Global headline inflation is expected to steadily decline from its peak of 8.7 percent in 2022 (annual average) to 6.9 per cent in 2023 and 5.8 per cent in 2024 (Table 1.1). The forecast for 2024 is revised upward by 0.6 per centage point, reflecting higher-than-expected core inflation. On a year-over-year basis, projected global headline inflation peaked at 9.5 per cent in the third quarter of 2022 and is projected to reach 5.9 percent by the fourth quarter of 2023 before falling to 4.8 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2024, still above the prepandemic (2017–19) annual average of about 3.5 percent. Although mone- tary tightening is starting to bear fruit, a central driver of the fall in headline inflation projected for 2023 is declining international commodity prices. Nearly three-quarters of economies are expected to see lower headline inflation in 2023, but the pace of disinflation is especially pronounced for advanced economies (Figure 1.18). These economies are expected to see (annual average) inflation fall by 2.7 per cent- age points in 2023, about double the (1.3 per centage point) decline projected for emerging market and devel- oping economies. Part of this difference reflects advanced economies’ benefiting from stronger monetary policy frameworks and communications, which facilitate disinflation (Chapter 2), but the difference also reflects lower exposure to shocks to commodity prices and exchange rates. In low-income developing countries, inflation is on average projected to be in double digits and is not expected to fall until 2024. There are also large differences in the expected pace of change in headline inflation across major economies, as Figure 1.19 reports, reflecting different starting points. The euro area is expected to see an especially sharp fall in (year-over-year) inflation in 2023––of 6.6 per centage points––from 9.9 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2022 to 3.3 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2023, with the fall reflecting in part the decrease in energy prices. In the United States, where inflation peaked earlier, the forecast is for a fall of 3.9 per cent- age points, from 7.1 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2022 to 3.2 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2023. In China, where inflation declined to near zero in the second quarter of 2023, a gradual rise––to still-low levels––is projected for the second half of 2023 as the drag from lower commodity prices wanes. Core inflation is generally projected to decline more gradually than headline. Globally, it is set to decline modestly, from 6.4 per cent in 2022 (annual average) to 6.3 per cent in 2023 and 5.3 per cent in 2024. It is pr oving more persistent than projected, with upward revisions of 0.3 per centage point and 0.6 per cent- age point for 2023 and 2024, respectively, compared World Advanced economies Emerging market and developing economies Figure 1.18.

The drivers of the upside revisions differ by economy but reflect, in several cases, still tight labor markets and stickier-than-expected services inflation, as well as, in some cases, including Türkiye, which accounts for the bulk of the global upside revision for 2024, the effects of past currency depreciations and the related pass-through into underlying inflation. On an annual average basis, over half of economies are expected to see no decline in core inflation in 2023. On a fourth-quarter-over-fourth- quarter basis, however, about 86 percent of economies (for which quarterly data are available) are projected to see a decline. Overall, returning inflation to target is expected to take until at least 2025 in most cases. Com- parison of official inflation targets with the latest forecasts for 72 inflation-targeting economies (34 advanced economies and 38 major emerging market and devel- oping economies) suggests that annual average inflation will exceed targets (or the midpoints of target ranges) in 93 per cent of these economies in 2023 ( F igure 1.20). Countries where inflation in 2023 is expected to average below target include China, Thailand, and Vietnam. In China, this projection reflects subdued core inflation in the context of substantial economic slack, with rising youth unemployment and pass-through from lower energy costs. In Thailand, this prospective outcome reflects strong pass-through from lower energy prices to core inflation as well as lower house price inflation. In Vietnam, it reflects a slowdown in economic activity and pass-through from lower energy prices. In 2024, inflation is still expected to exceed targets (or the midpoints of tar- get ranges) in 89 per cent of economies, with an expected median deviation of about 1 per centage point. By 2025, inflation is expected to be within only 0.2 per centage point of target (or the midpoints of target ranges) in most economies. Oct. 2023 WEO July 2023 WEO Update Apr. 2023 WEO Figure 1.19.

As Box 1.1 explains, five-year-ahead forecasts for this rate from both the WEO and Consensus Economics—which summa- rizes the medium-term projections of leading forecasters for more than 100 economies—have declined over the past few decades. The latest WEO forecast for global growth in 2028 is 3.1 per cent, as compared with a medium-term growth projection of 3.6 per cent just before the onset of the pandemic (at the time of the January 2020 WEO Update) and 4.9 per cent just before the onset of the global financial crisis (at the time of the April 2008 WEO). More than 80 per cent of economies have seen a slowdown in their growth prospects from 15 years ago, at the time of the April 2008 WEO. Three-quarters of this reduction in global growth comes from weaker prospects for per capita GDP growth rather than merely slower population growth. A decom- position of the drivers of weaker per capita growth pros- pects points to slower prospective capital accumulation per worker and slower total factor productivity growth as the largest contributors. The slowdown in labor force participation in advanced economies also contributed about a third of the overall decline in projected per capita GDP growth, in the context of changing demo- graphic trends because of population aging. Prospects for income convergence across economies have also dimmed. At the time of the April 2008 WEO, poorer countries in terms of per capita income were expected to grow significantly faster than richer ones. But this growth differential has declined over the subsequent 15 years. As a result, the expected number of years needed for poorer countries to close half the gap in income per capita with richer countries has increased significantly since 15 years ago. Dimming global growth prospects imply fewer resources available to navigate a shock-prone world and attract needed investments. Overall, based on current policies, a full recovery of global output to its prepandemic path is unlikely. Figure 1.21 reports the latest medium-term forecast for global GDP in trillions of dollars at 2023 prices. Even before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the inflation surge of 2022, there was little prospect of returning to the prepandemic path (as reflected in the January 2020 forecasts), with expectations of longer-term scarring, particularly for emerging market and develop- ing economies. Recovery to the prepandemic trend is now even more elusive. The latest projections for 2028 imply a global output loss of some 5.0 per cent, with respect to prepandemic projections, or $6.4 trillion at 2023 prices. Trade Growth Historically Low World trade growth is expected to decline from 5.1 per cent in 2022 to 0.9 per cent in 2023, before rising to 3.5 percent in 2024, well below the 2000–19 average of 4.9 percent. The projected decline in 2023 reflects not only the path of global demand, but also shifts in its composition toward domestic services; lagged effects of dollar appreciation, which slows trade owing to the widespread invoicing of products in dollars; and rising trade barriers. In 2022, countries imposed almost 3,000 new restrictions on trade, up from fewer than 1,000 in 2019. Meanwhile, global current account balances––the sums of absolute surpluses and deficits––are expected to narrow in 2023, following their significant increase in 2022 (Figure 1.22). As reported in the IMF’s 2023 External Sector Report, the rise in current account balances in 2022 reflected largely commodity price increases triggered by the war in Ukraine, which caused a widening in oil and other commodity trade balances. Over the medium term, global balances are expected to narrow gradually as commodity prices decline.

They are expected to moderate slightly over the medium term as current account balances gradually narrow. In some economies, gross external liabilities remain large from a historical perspective and pose risks of external stress. Risks to the Outlook: Tilted to the Downside but More Balanced Adverse risks have receded since the April 2023 WEO, implying a more balanced distribution of risks around the outlook for global growth. Economic activity has proved more resilient than expected, and inflation is on a downward path, surprising on the downside in a number of cases. In addition, earlier this year, the resolution of US debt ceiling tensions and swift action by Swiss and US authorities to contain banking sector turbulence reduced the immediate risks of broader financial stress. Nevertheless, concerns regarding global inflation and recession remain high (Figure 1.23), reflecting the still-challenging envi- ronment, and the balance of risks to global growth remains tilted to the downside. The most prominent risks and uncertainties surrounding the outlook are now discussed; a model-based analysis that quantifies risks to the global outlook and plausible scenarios follows in Box 1.2. Upside Risks More favorable outcomes for global growth than in the baseline forecast, which would strengthen the likelihood of a soft landing, are increasingly plausible: • U nderlying inflation falls faster than expected. Factors that could contribute to such an outcome include stronger-than-expected pass-through from lower energy prices or a compression of profit margins to absorb cost increases. Declining job vacancies could also play a stronger-than-expected role in easing labor markets, implying a downward shift in the ratio of vacancies to unemployment and reducing the need for further monetary tightening to curb inflation. As Box 1.2 explains, such developments would support economic growth by restoring purchasing power for households and allowing European creditors European debtors China United States Japan Others Oil exporters Discrepancy Figure 1.22.

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: Nav I g a T IN g gLO b a L D I v E R g E NCE s 20 In ternational Monetary Fund | October 2023 central banks to bring forward an easing in their policy stances. • D omestic demand recovers faster. In numerous econo- mies, the stock of excess savings accumulated during the pandemic has not yet been drained and con- sumption remains below prepandemic trends, raising the possibility of a faster-than-expected consumption recovery. The US labor market could again prove tighter than expected, supporting a more resilient consumption path. Stronger policy support in China than currently envisaged––through means-tested transfers to households in particular––could bolster the recovery and generate positive global spillovers. Furthermore, as Box 1.2 explains, private investment could recover more strongly to prepandemic levels than currently expected in response to current policy initiatives. Recent breakthroughs in artificial intelli- gence and progress in green technologies could also usher in a new period of strong productivity growth, boosting investment and growth. Downside Risks Despite the recent favorable growth surprises, numer ous adverse risks to global growth remain plausible: • China ’s economic growth slows further. Recent developments shift the distribution of China’s growth forecast risks to the downside, with negative implications for trading partners. The extent of the slowdown will depend largely on the Chinese government’s policy response. T o be effective, that response will have to preserve financial stability by expediting the restructuring of struggling property developers, facilitating the completion of housing projects, and addressing the growing strain in local government finances, all of which would help restore business and consumer confidence. Policy space has shrunk but is not fully exhausted. Given the lack of inflationary pressure, the People’s Bank of China has some room to ease. At the same time, fiscal expendi- tures can be reoriented toward spending, with higher fiscal multipliers, keeping the overall fiscal stance broadly neutral. For instance, targeted support to households can be provided while shifting away from increasingly ineffective and expensive invest- ment in infrastructure. In the most fiscally fragile provinces, financial stress in the real estate sector could end up spilling over to the rest of the financial sector via the sovereign-banking-corporate nexus and contagion through nonbank financial interme- diaries (see Chapter 1 of the October 2023 Global Financial Stability Report). Should concerns about financial stability in China fester, the impact could be felt in other emerging market economies through exchange rate volatility and destabilizing capital flows. Box 1.2 provides a quantification of the prin- cipal risks stemming from a deeper-than-expected contraction in the real estate sector in the absence of swift action to restructure property developers and unintended fiscal tightening in response to lower tax revenues for local governments. • Commodity prices become more volatile amid cli- mate and geopolitical shocks. Intense heat waves and droughts in the midst of record global temperatures this year have provided a taste of a more inhospitable future blighted by global climate change. More fre- quent crop failures across countries are likely, causing food price spikes and food insecurity. The ongoing El Niño phenomenon, which in the past typically has raised global food prices by more than 6 per cent in a year (European Central Bank calculations as cited in Schnabel 2023), poses further risks. The war in Ukraine and geopolitical tensions elsewhere could intensify, triggering supply chain disruptions and renewed fluctuations in food, fuel, fertilizer, and other commodity prices. The suspension in July of the Black Sea Grain Initiative and recent attacks on Ukraine’s grain facilities are concerns in this regard. In this context, a proliferation of export restrictions on agricultural products aimed at reducing domes- tic prices complicates the delivery of commodities to global markets, with the potential to exacerbate fluctuations in commodity prices. A rise in oil prices driven by a reduction in oil supply could reduce global economic activity and raise inflation, with the magnitude of the effects differing across regions. 4 Moreover, as Chapter 3 explains, intensifying geo- economic fragmentation could constrain the flow of commodities across regions, causing additional price volatility. Commodities are particularly vulnerable to trade restrictions, as their production is highly con- centrated as a result of natural endowments. Finally, shortages of energy resulting from lower investment in fossil fuel development that are not matched by 4As reported in Box 1.3 of the October 2022 WEO, a 30 percent rise in oil prices relative to baseline could reduce the level of global GDP by about 0.5 percent and raise global inflation by about 1.2 per centage points, relative to baseline. The analysis assumes monetary policy responds endogenously to movements in inflation. CHAPTER 1 gLO ba L P RO s PECT s a ND P OLICIE s 21International Monetary Fund | October 2023 corresponding increases in alternative clean energy supplies may cause more frequent energy crises. Such adverse supply shocks may affect countries asymmet- rically, with particularly acute effects on lower-income countries, where food and energy constitute a large share of household consumption. Serious effects are especially likely in sub-Saharan Africa, where food averages about 40 per cent of consumption. • U nderlying inflation persists. Tight labor markets and wage demands to compensate for past cost-of-living increases could contribute to persistent underlying inflationary pressures. In countries where companies’ profit margins have grown in the past two years, there may be room to accommodate a rebound in real wages without triggering further price increases. With economic activity slowing, market pressures could contain the pass-through from labor costs to prices. However, as Chapter 2 explains, near-term inflation expectations remain elevated and above target inflation rates, which may contribute to more persistent wage and price pressures. This would com- plicate the task of monetary policy in restoring price stability. The ample stock of excess household savings in some economies could, where the surpluses are still sizable, slow the effects of monetary policy tight- ening on inflation. Greater-than-expected pressures on underlying inflation could then force central banks to—again—raise rates by more than expected. • F inancial markets reprice. Financial markets have adjusted upward their expectations in regard to mon- etary policy tightening in recent months, but new upside inflation surprises would force a monetary policy reassessment and could trigger a sudden rise in interest rate expectations and falling asset prices—as happened in March. Movements such as these could further tighten financial conditions and stress banks and nonbank financial institutions whose balance sheets remain vulnerable to interest rate risk, espe- cially those highly exposed to commercial real estate. Contagion effects are possible. A flight to safety (Box 1.2), with an attendant appreciation of reserve currencies, would trigger negative ripple effects for global trade and growth and raise inflation in emerg- ing market and developing economies, especially those highly dependent on imports of food and fuel. • D ebt distress increases. Global financial conditions, which measure the cost of funding in capital markets, have generally eased since the March 2023 banking stress episode, but lending standards have tightened and loan demand has declined in the United States, the euro area, and some emerging market economies (see Chapter 1 of the October 2023 Global Finan- cial Stability Report). Moreover, borrowing costs for emerging market and developing economies remain high, constraining priority spending and raising the risk of debt distress. The share of emerging market and dev eloping economies with sovereign credit spreads above 1,000 basis points was 24 percent as of August: still much higher than two years ago (only 9.3 per cent). For sub-Saharan Africa, spreads still exceed 680 basis points in more than half of cases (Figure 1.24). The share of low-income countries (56 per cent) and emerging markets (25 per cent) in or at high risk of debt distress this year remains elevated, as it was last year. • G eoeconomic fragmentation intensifies, hampering multilateral cooperation. The ongoing separation of the world economy into blocs amid Russia’s war in Ukraine and other geopolitical tensions could intensify—with more restrictions on trade (in particular, trade in strategic goods, such as critical minerals); cross-border movements of capital, tech- nology, and workers; and international payments. Should this happen, the costs for global prosperity will be high. Over the long term, trade fragmenta- tion alone—that is, the splintering of countries into August 2021 August 2023August 2022 Figure 1.24.

Intensification of geoeconomic fragmentation would also hamper multilateral cooperation in providing crucial public goods, such as fighting climate change and future pandemics and ensuring energy and food security. • Social unrest resumes. Reports of social unrest— including protests, riots, and major demonstrations— have declined internationally since reaching elevated levels in late 2019 (Figure 1.25, which updates the index of Barrett and others 2022). However, a resumption of social turmoil, potentially as a result of future food and fuel price spikes, could hurt eco- nomic activity, particularly in countries with more limited scope to cushion the impact through policies (Hadzi-Vaskov, Pienknagura, and Ricci 2021). Social unrest could also complicate the passage and implementation of necessary reforms, including those relating to the energy transition. Globally Consistent Risk Assessment of the World Economic Outlook Forecast The risk of a hard landing has clearly receded since April, as the quantitative analysis in Box 1.2, based on the IMF’s Group of T wenty (G20) Model, illustrates. The estimated probability that global growth in 2023 will fall below 2.0 per cent—an outcome that has occurred only five times since 1970––is now about 5 per cent, down from an estimated 25 per cent at the time of the April 2023 WEO. For 2024, the probability of such an outcome is about 15 per cent, also down from about 25 per cent at the time of the April 2023 WEO. A contraction in global per capita real GDP—which often happens when there is a global recession—in 2024 has an estimated probability below 10 per cent. At the same time, the probability of global growth’s exceeding 3.8 per cent (the historical average during 2000–19) is also less than 20 per cent for 2024, highlighting the rela- tively slow outlook for global growth. T urning to prices, the probability that core inflation in 2024 will be higher than in 2023, instead of declining to 5.3 per cent from 6.3 per cent in 2023, is assessed at about 15 per cent. Policy Priorities: From Disinflation to Sustained Growth With inflation declining, policymakers are approach- ing the final stage of the inflation cycle that started in 2021. But despite the progress, persistent policy challenges remain. Underlying inflation is still too high in most countries and could easily persist, and bud- getary space for needed investments is constrained in many cases, particularly in lower- and middle-income countries saddled with unsustainable debts. Putting a priority on supply-enhancing reforms that front-load gains and foster buy-in would narrow the large output losses projected under current policies, especially for emerging market and developing economies. Mit- igating the negative effects of climate change and geoeconomic fragmentation and protecting the most vulnerable will require swift and internationally coordi- nated policy actions. Policies with Near-Term Impact Durably restoring price stability: With global core inflation still high and declining slowly, central banks should generally maintain a tight stance and avoid prematurely easing monetary policy. At the same time, there are fewer cases in which sizable interest rate hikes are warranted, with increasing differentiation across countries’ policy needs for ensuring price stability. • R eturning inflation to target: In economies in which inflation is still elevated and persistent, a restrictive stance—with real rates above neutral—is needed until All EUR APAC ME&CA SSA WH Figure 1.25.

CHAPTER 1 gLO ba L P RO s PECT s a ND P OLICIE s 23International Monetary Fund | October 2023 clear signs emerge that underlying inflation is durably cooling. This is critical to safeguarding the success of many central banks in keeping longer-term inflation expectations anchored. As Chapter 2 explains, strong monetary policy frameworks and effective commu- nication are vital for minimizing the output costs of disinflation. Once underlying inflation is clearly cooling, with inflation and inflation expectations approaching the target, moving rates gradually to a more neutral policy stance may be warranted, while signaling continued commitment to price stability. For countries with inflation already below target, easing policies may be necessary to reduce the risks of inflation expectations de-anchoring. • N avigating uncertainty along the disinflation path: The task for central banks is complicated by the difficulty of estimating with confidence levels of neutral rates of interest and of unemployment, as well as by lags in policy transmission (see Box 1.2 of the April 2023 WEO), uncertainties associated with forecasting inflation in this environment, and the differing potency of the transmission mecha- nism across economic sectors. Calibrating monetary policy will require weighing the costs of lowering nominal rates prematurely versus those of delay- ing too much. • Coor dinating monetary and fiscal policies: Although the primary responsibility for restoring price stabil- ity lies with central banks, legislated government spending cuts or tax increases aimed at ensuring public debt sustainability can, by reducing aggregate demand and reinforcing the overall credibility of disinflation strategies, further ease inflation. This is especially the case in countries with overheated economies and steep inflation-unemployment trade-offs. By the same token, in economies with inflation below target, fiscal expansion or a tilting of government spending toward items more supportive of demand, such as targeted household transfers, may be necessary, subject to available budgetary room for maneuver. • M onitoring financing conditions: Financing condi- tions in capital markets have eased in the United States and the euro area (Adrian, Natalucci, and Wu 2023), which may complicate the task of fighting inflation. Careful monitoring of serious misalignment in financing conditions is warranted given the potential repercussions from a sudden repricing of risk. Central banks should be ready to deploy necessary financial stability tools to con- tain signs of market strain (Adrian, Gopinath, and Gourinchas 2023). Strengthening financial supervision and addressing stress: The fast pace of monetary policy tightening continues to put the financial sector under pressure. Strengthened supervision (through implementation of Basel III and removal of forbearance measures) and the monitoring of risks to anticipate further episodes of banking sector stress are warranted. The intensity of supervision should be commensurate with banks’ risks and systemic importance, and it is essential to rapidly close oversight gaps in the nonbank financial sector. Macroprudential policy measures could be employed preemptively to tackle emerging risks in banks and nonbank financial institutions. Where market strains emerge, deploying tools that provide liquidity support promptly and forcefully, while mitigating the risk of moral hazard, would limit contagion. In China, where continued financial stress in the property sector pres- ents a downside risk to global growth, stronger action by the central government is needed to avert macrofi- nancial feedback loops. This action should include fur- ther efforts to facilitate the exit of insolvent developers while protecting home buyers’ interests, which would also help restore home buyer confidence. Countries at risk of external shocks can make full use of the global financial safety net afforded by international financial institutions, including IMF precautionary financial arrangements.

In low-income and developing countries, interest payments constitute nearly one-eighth of general government revenues. For countries with lim- ited fiscal space, shifting the composition of spending toward items that provide targeted support to house- holds can support activity. Careful communication of medium-term fiscal policy plans is needed to support credibility and avert disruptive market responses. Where countries are in or at high risk of debt distress, achiev- ing debt sustainability may require not only well-timed fiscal consolidation, but also debt restructuring (see Chapter 3 of the April 2023 WEO). Domestic revenue mobilization, more efficient spending, and improved institutional fiscal frameworks are increasingly pertinent for emerging market and developing economies given high debt levels and sizable spending needs. Supporting the vulnerable: The composition of fiscal adjustment should protect the most vulnerable, by means of targeted support to households, among other methods, especially in the context of large swings in energy and food prices. Phasing out untargeted fiscal measures, especially those that blunt price signals— such as energy subsidies—is warranted as energy prices return to prepandemic levels. Avoiding debt distress: Large short-term external financing needs are stretching the ability of numerous emerging market economies and low-income coun- tries to service their debt. Sovereign spreads remain elevated, impeding access to credit for many economies reliant on short-term borrowing. Faster and more efficient coordination on debt resolution, through the G20 Common Framework and the Global Sovereign Debt Roundtable, among other options, would help mitigate the risk of debt distress spreading. The recent agreement between Zambia and its official creditor committee is a welcome step in that direction. Improving food security: Extreme weather conditions— heat waves, floods, and wildfires—are exacerbating risks to the global supply of staple crops, including risks from the war in Ukraine, and threaten food security for mil- lions of people. In this context, trade restrictions aimed at reducing domestic prices could worsen global food insecurity and create shortages for the world’s poorest people. Bans on food exports should be lifted as soon as feasible to safeguard the global flow of food supplies. Strengthened multilateral cooperation on food security is needed, with strengthened rules-based frameworks for restrictions on food exports (see Chapter 3). E nhancing labor supply: Reforms that reduce labor market tightness—by encouraging participation and reducing job search and job matching frictions—would facilitate fiscal consolidation and contribute gradually to easing inflation. Such reforms include short-term training programs for professions experiencing short- ages and labor laws and regulations that increase work flexibility through telework and leave policies. Policies that encourage more women and older people to join the workforce, reduce labor market duality, and improve mobility would further enhance labor supply. Active immigration policies in advanced economies can address labor shortages as well as longer-term headwinds to growth, including those from population aging. Policies with Medium-Term Payoffs Intensifying macrostructural reforms: Targeted and carefully sequenced structural reforms can equip policy- makers with additional levers to reinforce productivity growth despite constrained policy space. This is all the more important given the decline in medium-term growth prospects (Box 1.1). Making a priority of and bundling reforms that alleviate the most critical binding constraints to economic activity—such as governance, business regulation, and external sector reforms—can help front-load the resulting output gains, which helps ensure public buy-in. IMF staff analysis for emerg- ing market and developing economies (Budina and others 2023) suggests that output gains from reforms can be substantial, even in the short term. In cases with large initial gaps in structural indicators relative to the best performance, a bundled and sequenced reform package is estimated to lift the level of output by 4 per cent in two years and 8 per cent in four years. Gains of this magnitude would significantly narrow the aforementioned output losses from the pandemic for these economies. More broadly, reforms ranging from enhancing human capital by expanding health care coverage and increasing access to early childhood and higher education, to reducing barriers to competition and supporting start-ups, to deepening digitalization would, depending on the economy in which they were enacted, enhance productivity. By accelerating growth, such reforms can also help assuage concerns about potential short-term growth costs of ambitious green reforms, including those that operate through energy CHAPTER 1 gLO ba L P RO s PECT s a ND P OLICIE s 25International Monetary Fund | October 2023 prices (see Chapter 2 of the October 2022 WEO), and create the necessary fiscal space for implementation. In general, mitigating the potential adverse distributional effects of reforms across economic groups (including those relating to gender and age) requires complemen- tary policies, including targeted support and regulations to ensure that the reform benefits are shared. Industrial policies could be pursued where externalities or market failures are well established and other policies are not available but should avoid protectionist provisions and be consistent with international agreements and World T rade Organization (WTO) rules. Speeding the green transition and mitigating the effects of climate change: Reductions in global emis- sions are needed to mitigate climate change. Envi- ronmental performance varies widely across firms within industries (Figure 1.27). Laggards—firms with high emissions per unit of output relative to indus- try peers—operate older physical capital and are less knowledge-intensive and productive (Capelle and others, forthcoming). Significant emissions cuts could be achieved by helping these firms approach current technological frontiers. Carbon pricing and subsidies for green investments would support the adoption of frontier technologies, helping make production both greener and more efficient. Carbon border-adjustment mechanisms can encourage trading partners to decar- bonize and can ensure an equal footing for domestic producers and those in countries with less ambitious carbon-emissions-reduction targets, but they must be designed carefully to support consistency with WTO rules. Green industrial policies—currently pursued in China, the United States, and the European Union— complement carbon pricing to speed the transition. However, they also should be designed in a manner that avoids distortions to international trade (such as domestic-content provisions) and investment, also in line with WTO rules. In parallel, investments in climate adaptation activities and infrastructure are needed, especially for the regions most vulnerable to climate shocks. Enhancing climate-risk-monitoring systems and risk management frameworks and stronger safety nets and insurance are also needed to enhance climate resilience (October 2023 Fiscal Monitor). Establishing a “green corridor” and increasing data sharing: A green corridor agreement is necessary to safeguard the international flow of critical miner- als needed for the green transition. It should tran- scend geopolitical boundaries and be guided by the principles of common climate goals rather than beggar-thy-neighbor policies. Similar agreements could stabilize essential agricultural commodity markets by dampening supply volatility in the wake of adverse shocks. Prudent risk management also calls for investing in diversified supply sources to minimize the potential fallout in case of further fragmentation in commodity markets. A lack of data on critical minerals for the green transition raises uncertainty for producers and consumers and leads to price volatility. An inter- national platform or organization could improve data sharing and standardization (see Chapter 3). S trengthening multilateral cooperation and mitigating the effects of fragmentation: Multilateral cooperation is vital for achieving progress in dealing with the inter- locking challenges holding back global recovery. Joint action is needed on many fronts, and further geo- economic fragmentation would trigger costly delays. Restoring trust in multilateral frameworks is urgently needed to revive a rules-based platform of international cooperation, to foster shared global prosperity, and to regulate potentially disruptive emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence. At the center of such reforms, enhancing trade policy certainty should be a priority. Necessary first steps should include restoring binding dispute settlement in the WTO and clarifying the application of key WTO rules to climate measures.

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: Nav I g a T IN g gLO b a L D I v E R g E NCE s 26 In ternational Monetary Fund | October 2023 Since the global financial crisis in 2008, forecasters have steadily diminished their expectations for growth over the medium term. Global five-year-ahead growth projections from the World Economic Outlook (WEO) have declined from a peak of 4.9 per cent in the April 2008 WEO for growth in 2013 to 3.0 per cent in the April 2023 WEO for growth in 2028: the lowest pro- jection since 1990 (Figure 1.1.1). Forecasters at other institutions—as surveyed by Consensus Economics–– have similarly reduced their expectations. If the focus is WEO forecasts, the decline in growth prospects started in the early 2000s for advanced economies, while emerging market and developing economies experienced a similar decline after the crisis. Of the 1.9 per centage point global decline in medium-term growth prospects from 2008 to 2023, advanced economies contributed 0.8 per centage point; emerg- ing market and developing economies contributed 1.1 per centage points. Among emerging market and developing economies, low-income developing coun- tries increased their contribution to projected global growth slightly during the same period (Figure 1.1.2). The world’s largest 10 economies, and 81 percent of all economies, have seen a decline in their medium-term growth prospects (Figure 1.1.3). The five largest emerging markets––Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, and Russia––have contributed about 0.9 per centage point to the decline in medium-term global growth prospects between 2008 and 2023. East Asia and the Pacific’s outlook has seen the largest downshift. The global medium-term outlook further declined after the shocks of 2020–22—including the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine––from 3.6 per cent in the January 2020 WEO to 3.0 per cent in the April 2023 WEO, with 52 per cent of econo- mies (all of them middle-income economies) seeing a decline. A natural question is whether the decline in forecasters’ expectations for the global economy over the past 15 years has been excessively pessimistic, with outcomes likely to be better than expected. An examination of the bias in WEO forecast errors over time––the average difference between actual outcomes and forecasts––suggests that the answer is no. Forecasts were mostly aligned with growth outcomes during 1995–2008. After the global financial crisis, forecasts exhibited––if anything––some upward bias, with realized growth over the medium term falling short The authors of this box are Nan Li and Diaa Noureldin.

Dimming Growth Prospects: A Longer Path to Convergence CHAPTER 1 gLO ba L P RO s PECT s a ND P OLICIE s 27International Monetary Fund | October 2023 of medium-term predictions.1 This suggests that the downward trajectory in the projections could in part reflect correcting for forecast optimism since the crisis. A deeper look through forecasters’ lenses sheds light on the factors driving the decline. First, three-quarters of the reduction in global growth prospects (about 1.4 per centage points) over the past 15 years has come from weaker per capita growth projections rather than merely slower population growth. Second, it is instructive to note that per capita growth can be decomposed into changes in capital per worker (or “capital deepening”), labor force participation, the employment rate (employ- ment as a share of the labor force), and total factor productivity (TFP) (see Abiad and others 2009). 2 1The assessment is based on the regression e i,t = α + ε i,t , in which e i,t is the growth forecast error, defined as the five-year end-of-period moving average of realized growth rates minus the five-year-ahead forecast, conducted as a vintage-by-vintage regression over the period 1990–2017, with the last vintage chosen to compare against the output realization for 2022. The results are robust to using actual growth rates instead of the moving average. 2The term capturing labor force participation also reflects changes in the share of the working age population in total population. For advanced economies, the decline in per capita output growth in the recent forecasts relative to the forecasts for the early 2000s is attributed predomi- nantly to lower TFP growth, followed by the decline in labor force participation and the slowdown in capital deepening (Figure 1.1.4). This reflects fore- casters’ views on future TFP growth, potentially due to unbalanced technological advances across sectors (Acemoglu, Autor, and Patterson 2023), frictions preventing efficient resource allocation (Baqaee and Farhi 2020), or diminishing returns to innovation (Bloom and others 2020). The projected decline in the contribution of labor force participation, which is broad-based across advanced economies, could reflect forecasters’ views on the impact of population aging. The decline in the contribution of capital deep- ening could reflect views on declining investment prospects over time, partly on account of scarring effects on capital formation after the global financial crisis, and is most pronounced in regard to euro area economies. 3 For emerging market and devel- oping economies, the decline in TFP growth is also the largest contributor to the slowdown, explaining about 60 percent, followed by the decline in capital deepening. The projected decline in TFP growth in emerging market and developing economies could reflect fading effects of technological and educational improvement, the slowdown in reform momentum in the 2000s relative to the 1990s (October 2019 WEO), and rising fragmentation risks that would hurt growth in world trade and global value chains. The projected slowdown in capital deepening is also a significant contributor in some of the largest emerging market and developing economies— such as Brazil and Indonesia. 4 The decline in medium-term growth prospects, especially in emerging market and developing econ- omies, has worrisome implications for the pace of convergence in living standards. Fifteen years ago, 3The scarring effects of the global financial crisis on invest- ment are documented in the April 2015 World Economic Outlook. A potential explanation is the relatively larger fiscal consolidation in euro area economies after the crisis. This may have prompted expectations of a slower rate of capital accumula- tion, given evidence suggesting strong complementarity between public and private investment in European economies (Brasili and others 2023). 4These trends are generally consistent with estimates of potential output growth (see, for instance, Kilic Celik, Kose, and Ohnsorge 2023).

Box 1.1 (continued) WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: Nav I g a T IN g gLO b a L D I v E R g E NCE s 28 In ternational Monetary Fund | October 2023 the five-year-ahead growth forecasts in the April 2008 WEO implied a positive and statistically significant rate of absolute convergence––with poorer countries growing unconditionally faster than rich countries by 0.9 per cent annually. At this rate of convergence, economies’ progress in raising their living standards and the associated decline in the rate of change might have been expected to translate into a decline in global growth over time. Accordingly, IMF staff estimates suggest that up to 0.4 per centage point of the aforementioned decline in per capita global growth prospects since 2008 may reflect income convergence. 5 In contrast, the five-year-ahead growth forecasts in the April 2023 WEO imply a convergence rate of only 0.5 per cent a year, corresponding to the flatter relationship shown in Figure 1.1.5. These forecasts imply that the expected number of years needed for emerging market and developing economies to close half the gap in income per capita with advanced econ- omies has significantly increased. For example, based on the population-weighted estimates in Figure 1.1.5, this half-life estimate has on average increased from 80 years for projections in the April 2008 WEO to about 130 years for projections in the April 2023 WEO. What is more, these estimates are population weighted, meaning that they give greater weight to more populous and faster-growing countries, such as China and India. Unweighted regressions—indicated in the figure by black lines—show even slower expected convergence rates that decline to near zero in the April 2023 WEO projections. Poorer countries have already suffered greater income losses during the recovery from the pandemic (Brussevich, Liu, and Papageorgiou 2022). The slower prospects for income convergence suggest a particularly difficult road ahead. 5The expected (absolute) convergence rate implied by projec- tions in the April 2008 WEO is 0.3 per cent when each country is treated as a unit of analysis and 0.9 per cent when countries are weighted by population. Applying the 0.3–0.9 range of conver- gence rates to the level of initial GDP per capita across countries in 2008 implies a decline in global per capita GDP growth of 0.1–0.4 per centage point over 2008–23.

Uncertainty about 2023 has narrowed considerably since the April 2023 WEO as the outturn for the first half of the year is now known. Beyond 2023, risks to growth are considered more balanced than in the April 2023 WEO but still tilted to the downside. The risk of global growth falling below 2 per cent—an outcome that has occurred on only five occasions since 1970—in 2024 is assessed at about 15 per cent, compared with 25 percent in April. The balance of risks for inflation beyond 2023 has shifted up, reflecting upward revisions to the baseline projec- tion. The risk that core inflation in 2024 will be higher than in 2023 is assessed at about 15 per cent. The scenarios assess several risks to the outlook. Upside risks include (1) greater-than-expected disinflation effects from fading supply disruptions and (2) a greater boost to global demand from a stronger recovery in invest- ment in advanced economies. Downside risks include (1) further loss of growth momentum in China, (2) longer-than-expected transmission lags and larger effects from the ongoing global monetary tightening cycle, and (3) tighter financial conditions in emerging markets. Confidence Bands The methodology for producing confidence bands is based on Andrle and Hunt (2020) and was used in the October 2022 and April 2023 WEO reports. The G20 model, presented in Andrle and others (2015), is used to interpret historical data on output, inflation, and international commodity prices and to recover the implied economic shocks to aggregate demand and supply. The recovered shocks are sampled through non-parametric methods and fed back through the model to generate predictive distributions around the WEO projections. Distributions for global macro vari- ables are then obtained by aggregating country-level estimates. There are two changes to the distributions for growth and inflation outcomes relative to April. First, shocks from 1982 were sampled more heavily in the previous WEO to stress the risk of a more pronounced slowdown from contractionary monetary policy. Here instead, shocks are sampled uniformly, consistent with risks to the outlook having become more balanced. While risks from monetary policy The authors of this box are Jared Bebee, Harri Kemp, Pedro Rodriguez, and Rafael Portillo. remain relevant for the current outlook, they are evaluated through a scenario instead of a shift in the predictive distribution. Second, the distribution for 2023 shocks has shrunk as the outturn for the first half of the year is already known. Figure 1.2.1 (panels 1, 2, and 3) shows the distri- butions for global growth and inflation projections that result from the approach and assumptions just discussed. Each shade of blue represents a 5 per centage point interval, and the entire band covers 90 per cent of the distribution. Regarding global growth, the range of possible outcomes has narrowed and shifted up relative to April. There is a 70 percent probability that global growth will be between 2.6 percent and 3.4 per- cent in 2023—a narrower range than in April—and a 70 per cent probability that growth will be between 1.9 per cent and 4.0 per cent in 2024. Regarding global inflation, uncertainty around 2023 has narrowed for both the headline and core figures: there is now a 70 per cent probability that 2023 headline inflation could be about 0.7 per centage point higher or lower than currently projected, lower than the 1.2 per cent band shown in April. Beyond 2023, risks have tilted up with the revision to the baseline: the probability that headline inflation in 2024 will be higher than in 2023 is assessed at 25 per cent, com- pared with less than 10 per cent in April. Similarly, the probability that core inflation in 2024 will be higher than in 2023 is assessed at 15 per cent, compared with about 5 per cent back in April. Risk Scenarios The April 2023 WEO presented a single large down- side scenario for the world economy, centered around a large shock to credit supply. While financial risks remain, the probability of a severe scenario from bank- ing sector developments has receded. Instead, this box quantifies several upside and downside risks. While each of the risks quantified here implies relatively moderate effects on global growth and inflation, several could materialize at the same time, in which case the global impact would be correspondingly larger. The scenarios assume that monetary policy and automatic fiscal stabilizers respond endogenously to macro devel- opments, without additional policy support. Upside Risks Greater-than-expected global disinflation from further supply normalization: Supply constraints have been an important factor in the global inflation Box 1.2. Risk Assessment Surrounding the World Economic Outlook’ s Baseline Projections CHAPTER 1 gLO ba L P RO s PECT s a ND P OLICIE s 31International Monetary Fund | October 2023 surge experienced during the pandemic recovery, both directly through higher goods inflation early on and indirectly by raising marginal costs. As multiple indicators point to normalization, fading supply dis- ruptions are now helping with the ongoing disinfla- tion. The scenario assumes that the global disinflation impulse is greater than in the baseline forecast, with the consumer price of manufactured goods relative to services—currently estimated to be 1 per cent above the global aggregate trend prior to the COVID-19 pandemic—returning to trend over a two-year hori- zon. The additional impulse in the scenario is larger in countries, mainly advanced economies, that are start- ing from a higher relative goods price, with an impulse equal to –20 basis points of core inflation in 2023 and –50 basis points in 2024 (relative to baseline). For the remaining countries, except China, the impulse is two-thirds as large; China experiences a smaller shock. The lower-than-expected inflation raises purchasing power globally and allows central banks to lower rates at a more rapid pace over the scenario horizon, supporting global consumption, investment, and trade. Stronger recovery in investment in advanced economies: Investment has been lagging since the COVID-19 crisis period ended, with global gross fixed capital formation remaining close to 10 per cent below prepandemic trends. The scenario assumes investment grows by more than in the baseline over the next two years for several advanced economies, reflecting both (1) greater sensitivity to the expected recovery in some regions and sectors, and easing financial conditions, and (2) a stronger-than-expected boost from current policy packages (US Inflation Reduction Act, EU recovery fund). Higher investment supports global demand and trade but also adds to inflationary pres- sures, with the added assumption that Phillips curves are twice as sensitive to demand, as a result of the cur- rent inflation environment, which elicits a stronger pol- icy response. However, the increase is modest in size: in the scenario, investment is 3 per cent higher than the baseline by 2025 for the advanced economies group. Downside Risks Subdued confidence weighing on China’s out- look: The scenario assumes a deeper-than-expected contraction in the real estate sector in the absence of swift action to restructure property developers, weaker consumption in the context of subdued confidence, and lack of meaningful policy support. As a result, China’s private consumption and gross fixed capital WEO baseline projection 1. Real GDP Growth 2. Headline CPI Inﬂation 3. Core CPI Inﬂation Source: IMF staff calculations.

The shock fades beyond 2025. Longer transmission lags and greater-than-expected effects from global monetary policy tightening: The relative resilience of the global economy in the first half of 2023 has raised the question of whether the full effect from the ongoing global monetary tight- ening is yet to be seen. The scenario assumes that the effects are larger than what is in the current WEO baseline, that the additional impulse in each coun- try is proportional to the change in real rates since the beginning of the tightening cycle, and that the effects materialize by the end of 2023—and especially in 2024. The calibration draws on the uncertainty regarding transmission lags and magnitudes from dif- ferent models and empirical estimates. Specifically, the shock is calibrated for the United States and the euro area by comparing the effects so far from the tight- ening, from the IMF’s G20 Model—which happen early in the tightening cycle and are smaller—with the effects from the FRB/US model and the structural vector autoregression (SVAR) model in Gertler and Karadi (2015) for the United States and ECB-Base model for the euro area, which take longer and are generally larger. The differences between the two sets of estimates are then fed into the G20 Model as shocks to aggregate demand, resulting in lower activity and inflation and a decrease in the policy rate relative to the baseline. For other G20 countries, the shock to aggregate demand is calculated as the average of the US and EU estimates (for each 1 per centage point increase in the real rate) multiplied by that country’s real rate increase. The estimated shocks to demand are largest in advanced economies (Australia, Can- ada, UK, US) and some emerging market economies (Brazil, Mexico). T ighter financial conditions in emerging mar- ket economies: While the underlying cause is not included in the scenario, tighter financial conditions in emerging markets could result from a combination of higher-for-longer rates in advanced economies, especially the United States, and concerns about the implications for emerging market economies of lower growth in China. Following an incipient tightening toward the end of 2023, emerging market economies, excluding China, experience an increase in sovereign and corporate premiums of about 200 and 150 basis points, respectively, in the first half of 2024, relative to the baseline, with some of the tightening persisting into the second half of 2024 and into 2025. Relatedly, currencies of emerging market economies see a depr eciation of 10 per cent relative to the US dollar in the first half of 2024, relative to the baseline.

The scenarios highlight the broadly balanced nature of risks to the outlook: • The disinflationary scenario generates a decrease in global core inflation that troughs at –0.4 per centage point in 2024 relative to the baseline, generating a 0.5 per cent increase in global GDP in 2024, which persists into 2025. The effect is somewhat more pronounced in advanced economies; as a result, the latter group sees a decrease in policy rates of 0.3 per centage point, relative to the baseline. • The scenario of stronger recovery in investment in advanced economies generates a modest increase in global output of up to 0.3 per cent by 2025 and is associated with moderately higher inflation. The impact on GDP in advanced economies peaks at 0.6 percent in 2025, adding an additional 0.3 percent- age point to core inflation and requiring an increase in policy rates of about 0.75 per centage point, relative to the baseline. Spillovers to emerging markets are small. 1The impact on growth rates for a given year can be approxi- mated by subtracting the effects on the level of output from the previous year. • The downside scenario for China lowers its GDP by as much as –1.6 per cent in 2025, with a decrease in core inflation of about 1 per centage point, relative to the baseline. There are spillovers to other countries, and the effect on global output is –0.6 per cent by 2025. • The scenario of longer monetary lags results in a decrease in global output of about –0.4 per cent by 2024 and a modest decrease in global core inflation in that year (–0.1 per centage point). The effects are larger in advanced economies: –0.6 per cent for output and –0.2 per centage point for core inflation. The main reason for the modest impact on inflation is that policy rates are lowered by 50 basis points in advanced economies in 2024 relative to the base- line, which helps soften the impact. • T ighter financial conditions in emerging markets lower the level of global output by –0.5 per cent by 2024. The effects are more pronounced in emerging market economies, but advanced economies are also negatively affected because of the loss of compet- itiveness. The inflation responses diverge across country groups initially—the disinflation is initially muted in emerging market economies, whose currencies depreciate, and is more pronounced in advanced economies, whose currencies appreciate— before converging in 2025. Box 1.2 (continued) WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: Nav I g a T IN g gLO b a L D I v E R g E NCE s 34 In ternational Monetary Fund | October 2023 Primary commodity prices declined by 7.5 percent between F ebruary and August 2023. The widespread decline was led by base metals, with prices falling 15.7 per cent, and European natural gas prices, plummeting 36.0 per cent. The trend decline in cereal prices was temporarily halted by the collapse of the Black Sea Grain Initiative in July. Gold prices increased. This Special Feature ana- lyzes the commodity price channel of monetary policy. Commodity Market Developments Supply curbs supporting oil prices. Thanks to a rebound in July and August, crude oil prices increased, by 4.4 per cent, between February and August 2023, remaining, however, well below their peak of $115 in June 2022 (Figure 1.SF .1, panels 1 and 3). On the demand side, a weaker-than-expected rebound in China’s oil consumption, temporary reces- sion fears because of banking woes, and tighter mon- etary policy in many major economies all contributed to downward price pressures, especially in the second quarter of 2023. On the supply side, output curbs by OPEC+ (Orga- nization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries plus selected nonmember countries) of 1.2 million barrels a day (mb/d) announced in April—coupled with additional voluntary cuts of 1 mb/d and 0.3 mb/d by Saudi Arabia and Russia, respectively—were only partly offset by strong oil output growth in non-OPEC countries, most notably in the United States, where oil output is expected to increase by 1.1 mb/d this year. Western sanctions on Russian crude oil exports have had mixed effects: export flows of Russian oil have remained fairly steady, and its price discount relative to Brent oil has shrunk over time—Russian oil is trading above the $60 price cap imposed by the Group of Seven (G7) countries—as the size of the non-Western-aligned oil tanker fleet carrying Russian oil has increased, and as Russia appears to have set up its own maritime insurance.

Commodity Special Feature: Market Developments and the Commodity Price Channel of Monetary Policy 35International Monetary Fund | October 2023 Commodity Spe C ial Feature M ARKET DEVELOPMENTS AND THE COMMODITY PRICE CHANNEL OF MONETARY POLICY Futures markets suggest that crude oil prices will slide by 16.5 per cent year over year to average $80.5 a barrel in 2023 (from $96.4 in 2022) and continue to fall in coming years, to $72.7 in 2026 (Figure 1.SF .1, panel 2). The International Energy Agency expects oil demand to increase by 2.2 mb/d, reaching 102.2 mb/d in 2023, outstripping supply in the second half of the year. Uncertainty around this price outlook is elevated (Figure 1.SF .1, panel 3). Upside price risks stem from additional OPEC+ production cuts, a military escala- tion in the Black Sea, and insufficient investment in fossil fuel extraction. Downside price risks stem from a widespread global economic relapse, a slowdown in Chinese oil demand, and faster penetration of electric vehicles. Natural gas prices continue to normalize. European Title T ransfer Facility trading hub prices declined 36 per cent from February to August 2023 to a monthly average of $10.7 a million British ther- mal units (MMBtu) and within the upper range of historical prices. Lower demand, high storage over- hang from this past winter, and ample supplies of liquefied natural gas (LNG) and of pipeline gas from Norway and northern Africa have all lowered prices. Asian LNG prices declined by 26.4 per cent, roughly in lockstep with EU prices. US Henry Hub prices increased by 8.6 percent from February to average $2.6/MMBtu in August 2023. The price differential between US and European gas is expected to slow gradually as US LNG export capacity expansion picks up in 2024 and beyond. This is reflected in a slowly narrowing gap between the US and EU futures price curves. Title T ransfer Facility futures prices suggest that average annual prices could move from $13.6/MMBtu to $17.5/MMBtu in 2024 but then down to $9.1/ MMBtu by 2028. US Henry Hub prices are expected to rise from an annual average of $2.7/MMBtu in 2023 to $3.9/MMBtu in 2028. Metal prices have weakened. After a short-lived rebound during the winter, base metal prices declined by 15.7 per cent from February to August as China’s reopen- ing lost steam and its real estate sector, which together with construction accounts for roughly 20 percent of global metal consumption, kept faltering (Figure 1.SF .1, panel 1). Higher interest rates and weak European industrial demand also contributed to the negative market sentiment. Forecasts for base metal prices have also been revised downward since the April 2023 World Economic Outlook, with prices now projected to decline by 4.7 per cent in 2023 and 7.1 per cent in 2024. Gold prices remain high following a slowdown in the Federal Reserve’s tightening pace and continued demand for inflation hedges and alternatives to the dollar. Agricultural prices continue their downward trend. Between February and August, the IMF’s food and beverage price index lost 6.7 per cent, continuing its decline, though at a slower pace than in the second half of 2022. Prices of all major food commodities except sugar, rice, and pork contributed to the down- ward trend. As a result of a robust supply response in the 2022–23 season, grain prices fell consistently and in August stood 20.7 per cent lower than in February. Grain prices remain, however, 7.7 per cent above the average of the past five years. Food security concerns prompted recent export restrictions in India, the world’s largest rice exporter. Risks to prices are tilted to the upside, stemming mostly from the ramifica- tions of the end of the Black Sea Grain Initiative and uncertain effects of El Niño (see chapter text), pos- sibly exacerbated by the proliferation of food export restrictions. the C ommodity p rice Channel of m onetary p olic y Sharp fluctuations in commodity prices, among other factors, have been blamed for the recent global surge in inflation and for its subsequent fall (Figure 1. SF .2) (see, for example, Gagliardone and Gertler 2023; Blanchard and Bernanke 2023; and Ball, Leigh, and Mishra 2022). Commodity prices, however, are not exogenous with respect to the macroeconomy.

Headline Inﬂation (Month-over-month percent change, seasonally adjusted) WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: Nav I g a T IN g gLO b a L D I v E R g E NCE s 36 In ternational Monetary Fund | October 2023 part of the recent monetary policy reaction to inflation may have operated through a commodity price channel, as policy actions from major central banks affect global activity and financial conditions, which are typically major drivers of fluctuations in commodity prices. How quantitatively important is the commodity price channel of monetary policy—especially US monetary policy—in driving inflation in the United States and worldwide? Empirical analysis of this question has been limited. 1 This Special Feature contributes to filling the gap by estimating the effects of US monetary policy shocks on commodity prices and, through this channel, their spillback to the US economy and spillovers to con- sumer prices in other countries. It also looks at pass- through from commodity prices to consumer prices and potential asymmetries. A Conceptual Framework Among central banks, the Federal Reserve plays a special role. This is because the bulk of cross-border capital flows are denominated in dollars, and US mon- etary policy is a key driver of the global financial cycle (Dées and Galesi 2021; Miranda-Agrippino and Rey 2020). Changes in US interest rates thus have pro- nounced repercussions for the rest of the world (Rey 2013). 2 Therefore, this analysis will focus on the effects of US monetary policy shocks (for an analysis of the effect of European Central Bank shocks, see Online Annex 1.1).3 Conceptually, US monetary policy can affect commodity prices through (1) a cost-of-carry chan- nel, by affecting the opportunity cost of commodity 1Recent examples are Breitenlechner, Georgiadis, and Schumann (2022) and Ider and others (2023). 2The dollar is both an intervention currency and an anchor cur- rency (Gourinchas 2019). This helps propagate US monetary policy impulses from the center to the periphery and provides a common component to the global monetary environment. The spillovers of US monetary policy to the rest of the world are further strengthened by the importance of dollar funding for global bank balance sheets, as well as the increasing length and complexity of global supply chains (Bruno and Shin 2015). 3Policy rate comovement among central banks is elevated. More- over, US monetary policy shocks seem to lead to policy reactions and policy surprises from other central banks, such as the Bank of Canada and the European Central Bank (see Online Annex 1.1 for details). Kearns, Schrimpf, and Xia (2023) document that spillovers from other central banks are modest. In the case of China, typically it is fiscal policy that is more prevalently used for business cycle fluc- tuations rather than monetary policy. All online annexes are available at www .imf .org/ en/ Publications/ WEO. storage; (2) a real-economy channel, by affect- ing current and future commodity consumption; (3) a liquidity-and-portfolio channel, by affecting financial conditions and thus trading liquidity in physical and derivative markets; and (4) an exchange rate channel, as most commodities are traded in dollars. Since monetary policy typically has long lags affecting the real economy, an immediate effect of a monetary policy shock through the real-economy channel can work only through expectations and thus only for easy-to-store commodities. 4 The Effects of Monetary Policy Shocks on Commodity Prices: A High-Frequency Approach Local projections are used in the analysis pre- sented here to estimate the effects of monetary policy shocks—as in Jarociński and Karadi (2020)—on commodity prices. 5 The strongest impact is found for industrial metals (for example, nickel and copper) and oil. A 10 basis point monetary policy surprise leads to a 2.5 per cent drop in the base metal price index and a 2 per cent drop in oil prices, with the peak responses after about 20 days (see Figure 1.SF .3). Prices for raw materials, such as cotton and rubber, also have a sim- ilar decline, whereas the reaction of food prices, such as those for cereals, is smaller (less than 1 per cent) and less precisely estimated. Results are consistent with the cost-of-carry and real-economy channels, as higher interest rates increase the opportunity costs of holding inventories and, through the delayed effect on economic activity of higher funding costs, reduce future demand. These effects are more relevant for commodities with high storability (for example, base metals). 6 The gold price reaction is very precisely estimated, with the price dropping by 1.1 per cent after 23 days. For a given exchange rate, this sets a cap for the cost-of-carry chan- nel, since gold prices are moved, during normal times, 4Sizable monetary policy shocks can also have a nonlinear effect on commodity prices (Miao, Wu, and Funke 2011). 5Only dollar-denominated commodity prices are considered for 1990–2019. The pure monetary policy surprise from Jarociński and Karadi (2020), which does not consider central bank information effects, is used. More details are presented in Online Annex 1.1. 6The responses of natural gas prices (Henry Hub) are not consid- ered, as gas markets present important structural changes throughout the sample. For the period 1990–2019, natural gas prices do not respond to US monetary policy. However, for the 2016–19 subsa- mple only, when US natural gas exports increased dramatically, a significant decline in gas prices after US monetary policy tightening is observed. 37International Monetary Fund | October 2023 COMMODIT y S PECIAL F EATURE Ma RKET DE v ELOPMENT s a ND THE COMMODITY PRICE CH a NNEL OF MONET a RY POLICY mostly by the opportunity cost of storing gold. 7 Mone- tary policy shocks also affect the dollar, which appreci- ates by 0.4 per cent, but the impact is short-lived. 8 The Effects of Monetary Policy Shocks on Commodity Prices, Spillbacks, and Spillovers Next, to gauge domestic spillbacks and spill- overs from US monetary policy to other countries, a monthly proxy–structural vector autoregression approach is used. The analysis first looks at the effects of the commodity price channel on US inflation. It then moves on to the effects on other countries’ infla- tion. The focus is on prices of food and oil, which have the most direct effects on headline inflation. 7Except in the case of natural gas, the results are robust to choos- ing different subsample periods, suggesting that the relationship between monetary policy and commodity prices has not changed over time. This remains the case even if the sample is broken into segments before and after 2004, a year typically used to distinguish between periods before and after the financialization of commodity markets (Tang and Xiong 2012). 8This suggests that, conditional on a monetary policy shock, the correlation between the dollar and commodity prices is negative at high frequencies. Although there is evidence that the unconditional correlation between commodity prices and the dollar has changed since 2015 (Hofmann, Igan, and Rees 2023), the analysis presented in this Special Feature does not find evidence of a change in the rela- tionship between US monetary policy and commodity price indices for that period (see Online Annex 1.1 for details). The Spillbacks A 10 basis point increase in the US federal funds rate induces a decline in oil prices of 2 per cent on impact, and the effect persists for eight months. Food prices decline by 1 per cent, and the effect is less per- sistent. The responses of the headline consumer price index (CPI), industrial production, and the exchange rate are in line with the textbook implications of a monetary policy tightening (see Figure 1.SF .4 and Online Annex 1.1).9 9In addition to the monetary policy instrument, the first specifica- tion considers seven macroeconomic variables: the one-year T reasury bill, US headline CPI, US core CPI, US industrial production, the excess bond premium, the US dollar, the West T exas Intermediate oil price, and a food price index. The data span 1990–2019. The focus on food and energy commodities is because their pass-through to headline inflation is more direct and less delayed than those of other commodities, such as metals, fertilizers, and raw materials.

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: Nav I g a T IN g gLO b a L D I v E R g E NCE s 38 In ternational Monetary Fund | October 2023 T o isolate the commodity price channel of US monetary policy, in the spirit of Bernanke, Gertler, and Watson (1997), the impulse response functions are esti- mated again, with the condition imposed that US mon- etary policy has no effect on (1) oil prices and (2) both oil and food prices. If the commodity price channel is shut down, US monetary policy has smaller effects on the CPI. As Table 1.SF .1 shows, absent oil and food price responses, headline CPI would have declined by 0.07 per centage point rather than by 0.12 per cent- age point in the first half-year, implying a 41 percent contribution of the commodity price channel. The contribution is similar for the first year, but it declines over time as core inflation becomes the main driver (see Figure 1.SF .4, panel 4). Oil prices have a dominant role, since oil prices affect food prices but not vice versa. An instrumental variable–local projection mediation analysis tends to confirm these results, with an average commodity price contribution of 43 per cent over a half- year period (see Table 1.SF .1 and Online Annex 1.1). The Spillovers Figure 1.SF .5 reports the effects of US monetary policy on countries’ CPI (in blue), along with the effect of US monetary policy on countries’ CPI absent the commodity price channel (red). 10 As expected, 10T o study the effects of US monetary policy on foreign inflation through commodity prices, the previous specification is augmented with the CPI of country i and the bilateral exchange rate for country i and the United States, with the estimate repeated for a set of 24 countries. The same decomposition is performed to study how much of the change in country i’s CPI is due to US monetary policy’s effect on commodity prices. most countries’ CPIs decline after a US monetary policy tightening. The role of the commodity price channel is quantitatively important for several coun- tries. As highlighted in Table 1.SF .1, for the average country, the commodity price channel accounts for 66 per cent of the total spillover of US monetary policy onto inflation in the first half-year. The oil price alone contributes 48 per cent. Asymmetric Pass-Through Some observers have suggested that in the most recent episode of heightened inflation, the pass- through from global commodity prices to domestic consumer prices increased. It has also been suggested that producers are eager to pass cost changes on to consumers when commodity prices are on the rise but refrain from doing so when commodity prices decline. Finally, producers may also pass a larger fraction of commodity price changes on to consumer prices when the changes to commodity prices are larger and happen more quickly, attracting the attention of producers by virtue of their salience.

For food inflation, there is no evidence that the pass-through is higher during commodity price booms than busts or that the pass-through for price increases is larger than that for price decreases. However, some evidence shows that the pass-through of large oil price shocks to domestic energy inflation could be twice the size of that for small ones (Figure 1.SF .6, panel 1). For food inflation, there is also evidence that the food price pass-through is heightened for larger and thus more salient shocks (Figure 1.SF .6, panel 2). Conclusions Monetary policy has a strong direct effect on commodity prices, especially those of industrial and storable commodities such as oil and metals. Spillbacks and spillovers to other countries from US monetary policy shocks are fast. After a 10 basis point monetary policy shock, the decline in oil and food prices over the course of six months reduces both domestic and other countries’ inflation by 0.05 per cent on average. This result implies that the commodity price channel of US monetary policy has relatively larger spillovers to other countries than spillbacks to the United States. Whereas the commodity price channel accounts for 41 per cent of the total decline in US headline CPI, it accounts for 66 per cent of the total decline in headline CPI for the average country in the sample. Spillovers from US monetary policy shocks tend to be more relevant for consumer prices in other advanced economies, whereas the reaction of consumer prices in emerging market economies and their commodity price channels are less precisely estimated, as emerging markets tend to have more regulated prices. There is no signifi- cant commodity price channel for core inflation. Major central banks, when setting policy objectives, should consider their spillbacks and spillovers through a com- modity price channel and expect stronger pass-through during times of sharp commodity price changes (relative to times of small changes). Finally, as the Federal Reserve tends to set the tone for the global monetary policy stance, and given that other major central banks such as the European Central Bank can also affect commodity prices, the commodity price channel could be strength- ened in periods of high monetary policy coordination.

While headline inflation has since come down as supply chain disruptions have eased and commodity prices have declined, core inflation is proving stickier. The specter of high inflation becoming embedded in expecta- tions and leading to pricing choices that keep inflation high haunts central banks. This chapter unpacks recent patterns in inflation expectations and studies their role in driving inflation, and the implications for monetary policy. Expectations from professional forecasters, financial markets, and households and a new indicator for firms’ views agree about broad inflation dynamics. Histori- cal episodes in which inflation expectations rose over a sustained period of at least a year suggest that it takes about three years for inflation and near-term (over the next 12 months) inflation expectations to come back to pre-episode levels on average, given historical monetary policy reactions. Although long-term (five years in the future) inflation expectations have generally remained anchored on average, near-term expectations have risen markedly across economies since 2022. Empirical esti- mates of the expectations channel point to the growing importance of near-term expectations for understanding inflation dynamics. Using a new macroeconomic model with a mix of forward- and backward-looking learners, analysis shows how economies with greater shares of more backward-looking learners prolong price pressures and diminish the potency of monetary policy, since such agents do not consider the future impacts of monetary policy. The share of backward-looking learners in the economy is estimated to be larger in emerging market than advanced economies. By fostering an increase in the share of forward-looking learners, improvements in monetary pol- icy frameworks and central bank communication strategies can help bring inflation back to target more quickly and at a lower output cost—in other words, they can increase the chances that the economy makes a “soft landing.” The authors of this chapter are Silvia Albrizio (co-lead), John Bluedorn (co-lead), Allan Dizioli, Christoffer Koch, and Philippe Wingender, with support from Yaniv Cohen, Pedro Simon, and Isaac Warren.

Introduction In the wake of the shocks of the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, infla- tion around the world reached multidecade highs in 2022, well above central bank targets, particularly in advanced economies (see Chapter 1, Figure 1.7). As policy tightening gradually rebalances aggregate demand toward potential output, supply chain disrup- tions have eased, and commodity prices have declined, headline inflation is coming down, but underlying price pressures (as captured by core inflation) remain elevated. Professional forecasters expect inflation rates will return closer to central banks’ targets in 2024, with a shift in their median deviation toward zero and a sharp narrowing of the distribution (Figure 2.1).1 However, they also expect that, given the current contractionary stance and anticipated policy action going forward, rates will be fully back at targets only by 2026, on average. Since consumption and investment decisions as well as price- and wage-setting processes partly reflect households’ and firms’ expectations about the future pace of price changes, inflation expectations play a critical role in shaping inflation dynamics. Amid the current higher inflation environment, some observers have expressed concerns that expectations could remain elevated or even rise further and long-term expecta- tions could de-anchor from target inflation rates. In turn, expectations that future inflation will rise could feed into current inflation rates, keeping them high. If an expectations channel for inflation is important, it also means that policies that bring expectations down could help to lower inflation more quickly and easily. The idea is that the more effective monetary policy- makers are in influencing inflation expectations, the lower the cost in forgone output involved in central banks achieving their inflation objectives (Sargent 1983; Ball 1994). In other words, the expectations channel is critical to whether central banks can achieve 1Professional forecasters are typically private sector forecasters and do not include IMF forecasters that contribute to the World Economic Outlook forecasts.

MANAGING EXPECTATIONS: INFLATION AND MONETARY POLICY 2 CHAPTER 50 WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: Nav I g a T IN g gLO b a L D I v E R g E NCE s In ternational Monetary Fund | October 2023 the elusive “soft landing” of bringing the inflation rate down to target without a recession. The relevance of inflation expectations for an economy’s inflation dynamics likely depends on the prevailing context and recent experience, as well as on the measures of inflation expectations considered (for example, near- versus long-term mean expecta- tions). In general, when expected inflation is system- atically far from actual inflation, what expectations measure is most salient for understanding inflation dynamics is an open question (Werning 2022). When inflation is low and stable at central bank targets, economic agents may become inattentive, reducing the information content of expectations (Coibion and others 2020). This may have character- ized the situation in many advanced economies prior to the COVID-19 pandemic (Reis 2021). However, when inflation rises sharply or becomes volatile, then economic agents may become more attentive, and expectations may become an important driver of actual inflation. Motivated by these considerations, this chapter aims to contribute to the large and growing literature on inflation expectations by examining alternative indicators of inflation expectations, their importance for inflation dynamics, and how their behavior may influence monetary policy effectiveness and vice versa. 2 It addresses the following questions: • H ow have inflation expectations across different agents and at alternative horizons behaved before and after the pandemic across economies? Are there signs of inflation expectations deanchoring since 2021? Or do the rapid interest rate hikes over 2022 appear to have contained risks? • H ow important are expectations in explaining infla- tion dynamics, particularly since the COVID-19 shock? Does the prevailing level of inflation (high or low) affect the explanatory power of inflation expectations? • H ow do expectations affect monetary policy effec- tiveness, and how does policy affect expectations? How does the expectations formation process affect the trade-offs that monetary policymakers face to bring inflation rates back to their targets? Drawing on empirical and model-based analyses, the chapter’s main findings are as follows: • A cross economic agents, movements in near-term (next-12-months) inflation expectations broadly concur, showing a sharp rise in 2022. Survey-based measures of expectations of professional forecasters and house- holds, financial-market-implied expectations, and this chapter’s newly constructed measure of firms’ expectations (based on the text analysis of firms’ earnings calls) fluctuate differently, but around a common trend. • D espite the sharp increase in inflation over 2022 across many economies, long-term (five-year-ahead) inflation expectations in the average economy have remained sta- ble. According to multiple metrics—including infla- tion target deviations, expectations’ variability, and 2Recent IMF policy contributions on the topic include Chapter 3 of the October 2018 World Economic Outlook (WEO), which concluded that more anchored inflation expectations improve the economic resilience of emerging market economies; Chapter 2 of the Octo- ber 2021 WEO, which presented evidence that long-term inflation expectations remained anchored after the pandemic; and Chapter 2 of the October 2022 WEO, which found that the explanatory power of inflation expectations for wages after the pandemic had grown and that strong action by monetary policy to counter inflationary shocks could help ensure expectations remain anchored. Among the notable recent empirical and theoretical contributions on the topic of inflation expectations in the academic literature, see Bems and others (2021), Binder (2017), Coibion and others (2020), and Reis (2020), among many others. See also Kose and others (2019) for another overview of the literature and an examination of expectations in selected emerging market and developing economies. Note that the chapter’s focus on expectations should not be taken to suggest that they are the sole driver of inflation dynamics. They are a key contributor, but other factors are also important, as described later. Advanced economies Emerging market and developing economies Figure 2.1.

In these cases, it took about three years for inflation and near-term expectations to return to their pre-episode levels. Notably, real policy rates were lower and are now higher, on average, compared with those in past episodes, suggesting that monetary tightening since 2022 has been unusually sharp. • N ear-term expectations are critical to understanding inflation dynamics and explain a growing share of inflation since 2022. Using a novel causal identifica- tion strategy to estimate Phillips curves, the chapter finds a strong role for inflation expectations in the group of advanced economies. In emerging mar- ket economies, lagged inflation is also important, suggesting a greater role for more backward-looking learners. There are also signs that the pass-through from inflation expectations to inflation tends to be higher in periods of higher inflation, such as those experienced of late throughout the world. • The properties of the expectations formation process have a strong impact on the effectiveness of monetary policy, making central banks’ understanding of them key. A newly developed dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model with a mix of forward- and backward-looking agents that learn demonstrates that the output costs of monetary tightening rise with the share of backward-looking learners in the economy or with the prevailing level of inflation. 3 The analysis also shows that both inflation expec- tations and inflation would decline modestly more quickly with improvements in monetary policy frameworks and communication—such as simpler and more regular messaging and better targeting of audiences—that boost the share of forward-looking learners in the economy. However, such measures may take time or be more difficult to implement than tighter cyclical policies, which come with much higher costs in terms of slowing growth. In general, inflation dynamics depend on the shares of forward- versus backward-looking learners in the econ- omy and their influence on expectations. If central banks 3In technical terms, the forward-looking learners form their expectations according to the standard, full-information rational expectations assumptions, whereas the backward-looking learners form their expectations through adaptive learning based on a small statistical model of the variables of interest for expectations, updating the model based on recent and past experiences only. See Online Annex 2.5 for further details. were to focus solely on bringing inflation down quickly, they would tighten even further and reduce the time required to bring inflation rates back to targets by two years, but at the cost of a sharper economic slowdown. When policymakers choose policies to take account of the trade-offs among the objectives of inflation close to target, output at potential, and smooth policy rate paths (helping manage financial stability concerns), a scenario for a representative advanced economy facing today’s inflation cirumstances suggests that it is likely to take about three to four years for inflation and expectations to converge back to the central bank’s target. 4 Given the role of central banks in influencing the transmission of monetary policy, the chapter’s findings suggest that they benefit from having clear understand- ings of the expectations formation processes at work in their economies and tailoring their communica- tions strategies accordingly, in parallel with structural reforms to reinforce central bank independence and transparency. Managing expectations better could require investing more in data collection and monitor- ing of expectations, including across different agents. T echnological improvements mean that alternative methods of measuring expectations—such as the text-based analysis of firms’ earnings calls pioneered here—may make this more feasible. Some caveats to the analysis and findings in this chapter should be highlighted. First, data limitations constrain the empirical analysis of inflation expec- tations across exercises and, especially, cross-agent comparisons. T o ensure the broadest sample cover- age, the chapter takes a macroeconomic perspective and focuses on mean expectations, typically among professional forecasters, rather than the distribution or behavior of individual-level expectations, which are not widely available. 5 This may be preferable, because the analysis can provide more practical insights for 4Note that this conclusion is based on a stylized social welfare function (see Online Annex 2.5 for more details). See Chapter 1 of the April 2023 Global Financial Stability Report for a discussion of the financial stability implications of the monetary policy stance and their impact on central bank choices. 5Although this chapter focuses on mean inflation expectations to ensure broad country coverage, the distribution of expectations across individuals might also play an important role. See Reis (2023) and Clements, Rich, and T racy (2023) for arguments regarding the importance for inflation of disagreements in expectations across indi- viduals and agents. Many of the latest studies dive into the micro- economic data on inflation expectations by individuals for specific economies, contrasting their properties across agents or undertaking randomized controlled trials to identify influences on expectations. See Andre and others (2022), Candia and others (2023), D’Acunto and others (2020), Weber and others (2022), and Weber and others (2023) for recent examples. 52 WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: Nav I g a T IN g gLO b a L D I v E R g E NCE s In ternational Monetary Fund | October 2023 policymakers, who likely face many of the same data constraints. Second, the causal interpretation of the Phillips curve estimates is conditional on the assump- tions of the instrumental variables estimation strategy based on lags. As detailed in Online Annex 2.4, the findings are largely robust to varying the timing of the instruments, providing some comfort. However, if the underlying assumptions do not hold, then the estimates should be interpreted as associational. Third, if there have been structural breaks in the behavior of the economy, then the empirical and historical analyses may not be as informative. State dependence in the Phillips curve analysis addresses one possible form of break. The model-based analysis also affords some insurance against potential structural breaks, incor- porating a limited form of structural change through learning. Fourth, the model-based analysis findings on the impact of improved monetary policy frameworks and communications on expectations and inflation are illustrative. The mapping from an increase in the share of forward- compared with backward-looking agents in the economy to monetary policy framework and communications improvements is stylized. 6 The chapter begins by presenting patterns in inflation expectations, focusing on the postpandemic recovery. It compares them with the observed patterns after historical episodes in which expectations rose over an extended period. The chapter then uses a novel identification approach to study the channel from expectations to inflation and how well recent inflation dynamics can be explained by expectations. The pen- ultimate section describes the results of a model-based analysis with a mix of forward- and backward-looking learning agents to examine how the expectations for- mation process may influence the conduct of monetary policy and vice versa. The final section suggests poten- tial policy actions in light of the chapter’s findings. Recent Patterns in Inflation Expectations This section first compares the recent behavior of infla- tion expectations across professional forecasters, financial markets, households, and firms for selected economies. 6Although the chapter demonstrates that improvements in mone- tary policy frameworks and communications are consistent with an increase in the share of forward-looking learners, it cannot exclude the possibility that other institutional or structural interventions (for example, educational attainment, fiscal frameworks, governance, and so on) could also be associated with a change in the expectations formation process. However, a full examination of these alternative interventions lies outside the scope of this chapter. It then analyzes the evolution of near- and long-term inflation expectations of professional forecasters. Finally, it puts current macroeconomic dynamics into historical per- spective by comparing them with those in past episodes in which both near- and long-term inflation expectations rose over a sustained period. Expectations on Broad Inflation Dynamics Similar across Agents Different economic agents may not have the same inflation expectations, reflecting their different information sets, attention, and priorities, among other factors. This subsection shows how indicators of near-term inflation expectations across agents (profes- sional forecasters, financial markets, households, and firms) have behaved since 2017 for a selected set of four major economies for which comparable data are available (Figure 2.2).7 T o address the scarcity of data on firm-level expectations across economies and time, a new indicator of firms’ inflation expectations is con- structed using text analysis of firms’ earnings calls (see Box 2.1 for details). For comparability, expectations by agent type are transformed into z-scores.8 Across economies, the four agents’ near-term expectations display broadly similar patterns, agreeing on the inflation upswing from 2021, but with some variation in the timing. They concur that inflation peaked in 2022 and is now on the downswing. Each of the indicators, by agent and across economies, reaches two-and-a-half to more than four standard deviations, pointing to the extraordinary size of the rise in infla- tion expectations during the postpandemic recovery compared with the experience since the early 2000s. Different agents’ inflation expectations exhibit slightly different properties. Households’ inflation expectations appear noisier, leading and lagging movements in other agents’ expectations (for the euro area and the United Kingdom, respectively). Financial-market-implied inflation expectations, derived from inflation-indexed bonds or inflation swaps, have continuous real-time availability, but disentangling the signal on expectations from the 7As noted in the introduction, the lack of widely available data on inflation expectations—particularly from financial markets, households, and firms—limits the economy and time coverage of the various analytical exercises undertaken in the chapter. 8The z-score transformation takes a variable and subtracts its sam- ple mean, then divides the resulting quantity by the sample standard deviation of the variable. It is unit free and implicitly range adjusted, allowing for ready comparison of dynamics across different variables. 53 CHAPTER 2 Ma N ag IN g Exp ECT a TION s: I NFL a TION a ND M ONET a Ry pOLIC y In ternational Monetary Fund | October 2023 fluctuating risk premium is challenging (Chapter 1 of April 2023 Global Financial Stability Report). Firms’ near-term inflation expectations tend to mark the upper bound of the cross-agents expectations range during the recent inflation surge. Professional forecast- ers’ expectations convey more signal but may suffer from herding and strategic behavior (Reis 2023). Typically, professional forecasters’ expectations fall somewhere between the more volatile, yet continu- ously available, market-implied and noisier household expectations. They also have the advantage of the broadest coverage among expectations measures across economies, time, and forecast horizon. As such, the analyses of the chapter mostly use the expectations of professional forecasters. Near-Term Inflation Expectations above Targets, Long-Term Contained When a larger set of economies is examined, a consistent picture emerges: near-term inflation expec- tations in deviation from central banks’ targets have risen, whereas deviations of long-term expectations have been broadly stable (Figure 2.3).9 For advanced economies, the period prior to the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in the first quar- ter of 2020 was marked by a mild undershooting of inflation expectations relative to target in both the near 9Central bank inflation targets are either explicit or implicit; see Online Annex 2.1 for further details on data sources.

Near-term expectations rose markedly after 2021. If anything, long-term expectations in advanced economies have moved closer to inflation targets since the pandemic. For emerging market economies, the distribution of near-term inflation expectations is somewhat wider and skewed to the upside, indicating greater variation in inflation experiences, particularly in recent quarters (Figure 2.3, panel 2). Median long-term inflation expectations have moved upward by a modest 10 basis points (Figure 2.3, panel 4). The interquartile range for long-term expectations has narrowed and shifted up somewhat. Overall, though, the patterns suggest that long-term inflation expectations have remained stable. For both advanced and emerging market economies, multiple metrics of inflation expectations anchoring— related to the average absolute deviations from target, variability of expectations over time, and disagreement about expectations across individuals—suggest that long-term inflation expectations have stayed anchored despite recent rises in inflation (see Online Annex 2.2). Although reassuring, this anchoring of long-term expectations should not be taken for granted—it likely reflects in part the active response of policymakers to dampen price pressures. History Suggests It Can Take Time for Inflation and Near-Term Expectations to Come Down Long-term inflation expectations have remained stable, but how unusual are the current paths of other major macroeconomic variables? T o put it into histori- cal context, the chapter compares the recent experience with that observed after historical episodes in which near- and long-term inflation expectations were rising for at least a year (Figure 2.4). C urrent paths for actual inflation are so far in line with historical medians, whereas near-term inflation expectations displayed a sharper increase and a faster decline compared with those in previous episodes. After inflation expectations persistently rose over a year, economies subsequently tended to see a gradual but slow decline in headline inflation and near-term inflation expectations. Both typically take about three years to revert to their pre-episode levels, although core inflation remained stickier. However, there is a large variability across experiences, as observed in the interquartile ranges. Median Median, AEs, 2022:Q4 = 0 Median, EMEs, 2022:Q4 = 0 Interquartile range Figure 2.4. Historical Episodes with Persistently Rising Near- and Long-Term Inﬂation Expectations (Percentage points relative to level at end of episode) After past episodes in which inﬂation expectations rose persistently for a year or more, it took about three years on average for inﬂation and near-term expectations to come back down to pre-episode levels. Compared with those in these historical episodes, recent long-term inﬂation expectations have been unusually stable and real policy rate paths sharper across economy groups. 1.

Inclusion as a historical episode requires four quarters in which both near- and long-term inﬂation expectations are rising. The sample spans 1989:Q4 to 2023:Q1, with exact time coverage varying by economy. A total of 32 historical episodes are identiﬁed, with 16 from AEs and 16 from EMEs. See Online Annex 2.3 for further details. AEs = advanced economies; CPI = consumer price index; EMEs = emerging market economies. 55 CHAPTER 2 Ma N ag IN g Exp ECT a TION s: I NFL a TION a ND M ONET a Ry pOLIC y In ternational Monetary Fund | October 2023 In contrast, recent paths for real policy rates and long-term inflation expectations appear different than the median paths in past episodes. On the one hand, real policy rates in 2022 were well below those in the comparative paths of earlier episodes, partly on account of the sharp and large rise in inflation. On the other hand, real rates are now well above the historical median, with the difference reflecting rapid monetary tightening and the latest falls in headline inflation. Unlike those in earlier episodes, long-term inflation expectations have been unusually stable coming into the recent high inflation regime. This is consistent with and supports the chapter’s findings on the recent stability and (so far) solid anchoring of long-term expectations. The Role of Expectations in Inflation Dynamics T o provide a better understanding of the role of expectations in inflation dynamics, this section con- siders a hybrid price Phillips curve framework that relates current inflation to a set of drivers, including inflation expectations, lagged inflation, and the out- put gap. 10 The section first assesses the explanatory power of different agents’ expectations for inflation and the relative importance of near- versus long-term expectations. Second, an instrumental variables approach is used to identify the causal impact of inflation expectations on inflation. Third, using the causal estimates, the section shows the contributions of different drivers to recent inflation dynamics for average advanced and emerging market economies. Finally, the section explores whether the effect of expectations on inflation changes with the prevailing level of inflation. 11 10See Chapter 3 of the October 2018 World Economic Outlook (WEO), Chapter 2 of the October 2021 WEO, and Chapter 2 of the October 2022 WEO for recent analyses looking at cross-economy estimates of Phillips curves (for prices and wages). Dao and others (2023) use a similar approach to analyze inflation developments in the United States and the euro area. See Online Annex 2.4 for further details on the estimation and analysis. 11Other potential important dimensions in modeling the Phillips curve relationship, such as time-varying coefficients, nonlinearities, structural breaks, and the influence of higher-order moments of measured expectations, as well as alternative measures of slack, are left for future work. Near-Term Expectations Matter Most for Inflation When considered one by one, alternative measures of inflation expectations (by agents or horizons) show differ- ent abilities to explain inflation when the hybrid Phillips curve model is used (Figure 2.5). The coefficient esti- mates represent the change in inflation associated with a one standard deviation increase in the indicated measure of expectations. 12 The first finding is that long-term inflation expectations have lower predictive power than near-term measures. Both financial-market-based and professional forecasters’ five-year-ahead inflation expec- tations have smaller standardized coefficients than other measures (Figure 2.5, bottom two sets of boxes and whis- kers). These results are consistent with those of recent 12The coefficients are standardized to account for the volatility of different measures and to allow a comparison of inflation forecasts with the new index of firms’ inflation expectations, which is based on a different scale. Because of lack of data availability, this compar- ison can be undertaken for the United Kingdom, the United States, and the euro area. Figure 2.5.

Sec- ond, there is remarkable consistency across professional forecasters’, financial markets’, and firms’ near-term infla- tion expectations (Figure 2.5, top three boxes and whis- kers). These results imply that a one-standard-deviation increase in expectations is associated with a 0.7 standard deviation increase in current inflation. 13 Finally, the coefficient for households’ near-term expectations falls somewhere between those for near- and long-term expec- tations of other agents. In light of these findings and crucially because of broader economy and time coverage, the baseline spec- ification of the hybrid Phillips curve is estimated using near-term inflation expectations from professional fore- casters (Figure 2.6). The estimated relationship suggests that a 1 per centage point rise in near-term expectations is associated with a 1.1 per centage point rise in cur- rent inflation among advanced economies, whereas for emerging market economies, the rise is about 13Coefficients for inflation expectations unadjusted for volatility range from 1.1 to 1.4. The estimated coefficients for long-term expectations are lower than those for near-term expectations. Exclud- ing the post-2019 period results in lower estimated coefficients, but similar patterns. 0.8 per centage point. Lagged inflation has little explan- atory power in advanced economies (slightly negative but not different from zero with statistical significance), whereas in emerging market economies, the carryover from the previous quarter’s inflation (about 0.2 per cent- age point) is statistically significant.14 Finally, the output gap has a statistically significant relationship with cur- rent inflation for both economy groups but is somewhat larger for the group of emerging market economies. Expectations’ Role for Inflation May Be Smaller Than Simple Statistical Associations Suggest The previous results document statistical associa- tions between current inflation and near-term inflation expectations—they do not account for the possibility that current inflation could drive expectations of future inflation or that omitted factors could be driving both. T o address these shortcomings and estimate the causal effect of expectations on inflation (the expectations channel), an instrumental variables strategy based on lags of near-term inflation expectations and the output gap is used to reestimate the hybrid Phillips curve. The strategy leverages the facts that these variables display serial correlation over time (current values are strongly related to their past values) and that lags of these vari- ables do not directly affect current inflation under the hybrid Phillips curve specification. 15 14Chapter 3 of the October 2016 World Economic Outlook (WEO) and Chapter 2 of the October 2016 and October 2021 WEO, respectively, as well as Kamber, Mohanty, and Morley (2020), also find higher coefficients for lagged inflation in hybrid Phillips curves in emerging market economies compared with those in advanced economies. Forbes, Gagnon, and Collins (2021) demonstrate that the coefficients on lagged inflation decrease when panel estimates include only advanced economies. These studies do not explore potential causes, but the higher prevalence of price indexation in many emerging market economies may account for these findings (Céspedes and others 2005; Frankel 2010; Kganyago 2023). In addition, weaker monetary policy frameworks, on average, could also contribute to the smaller relative role of expectations. It might also be rational for adaptive learners to rely more on past inflation when indexation is more prevalent and the credibility of policymaking institutions is lower. Improvements in monetary policy frameworks and communications in emerging market economies over the past 15 years (see Box 2.2) suggest that lagged inflation could play a reduced role in these economies’ inflation dynamics going forward. Finally, emerging market economies might suffer from larger mea- surement error on inflation expectations, which would lead to an attenuation bias and a relatively more important estimated role for lagged inflation. 15See Online Annex 2.4 for further details on the model specifica- tion, instrumental variables strategy, its performance and key results, and robustness checks. The instrumental variables estimates are stable across time periods. Advanced economies Emerging market economies Figure 2.6.

This implies that some of the observed variation in near-term inflation expectations reflects reverse causation (that is, higher current inflation drives up expectations of future inflation) or omitted factors that affect both current inflation and expectations. By removing these biases, the instrumental variables estimates provide a more accurate assessment of the expecta- tions channel. For the average advanced economy, inflation would rise by about 0.8 per centage point for a 1 per centage point rise in near-term expec- tations. The pass-through estimate for the average emerging market economy is about 0.4 per centage point. The difference in magnitudes, combined with differences in the relationship of current inflation to past inflation, suggests that expectations formation in emerging market economies on average tends to be more backward looking than what is observed in advanced economies. Expectations Explain an Increasing Share of Recent Inflation Dynamics The contribution to recent inflation dynamics of the expectations channel can be calculated using the causal estimates of the hybrid Phillips curve (Figure 2.8). F or the average advanced economy, factors other than expectations and lagged inflation initially drove most of the increase in inflation that took place over 2021–22 (Figure 2.8, panel 1). These include common global factors, such as the economic disruptions caused by the COVID-19 shock, large swings in commod- ity prices, and global supply chain issues, as well as the economy-specific effects of energy prices and the Advanced economies Emerging market economies Figure 2.7. Associational versus Causal Estimated Effects of Inﬂation Expectations on Current Inﬂation (Regression coefﬁcients) Accounting for the inﬂuence of current inﬂation on expectations of future inﬂation in the Phillips curve reduces the estimated effects of inﬂation expectations on current inﬂation by about 30 percent across economy groups. 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 1.4 CausalAssociational CausalAssociational Source: IMF staff calculations.

Even so, Figure 2.8 reveals a large and growing role for near-term inflation expec- tations in explaining inflation dynamics in the most recent quarters. 16 In contrast, lagged inflation had a small role. T urning to the average emerging market economy, once again factors other than expectations and lagged inflation were responsible for the peak in inflation in 2022 (Figure 2.8, panel 2). On average, expectations have played a significant but smaller role in accounting for headline inflation than among advanced econo- mies. On the other hand, lagged inflation explained almost half of the average rise in inflation since the first quarter of 2020. Higher Inflation Environment, Higher Pass-Through from Expectations The final exercise in the section consists of esti- mating whether the pass-through from inflation expectations to current inflation varies by the level of inflation: Are there signs of a nonlinearity or state dependence in the effect of expectations on inflation? In both advanced and emerging market economies, the estimated pass-through is higher when inflation is elevated (above its economy-specific sample median; Figure 2.9). The difference is particularly large, with the coefficient increasing from 0.6 when inflation is low (below its economy-specific sample median) to 0.9 when inflation is high and statistically significant for advanced economies. These results imply that the expectations channel may be even more important in accounting for inflation dynamics at present, while inflation remains high. Expectations Formation and Monetary Policymaking This section explores the question of how infla- tion expectations affect monetary policy effectiveness and how different policies can affect expectations. It uses a semistructural model to illustrate how the expectations formation processes in an economy 16Other factors have remained relevant in recent quarters despite a net contribution approaching zero, as shown by the gray bars in Figure 2.8, panel 1. This is because the pass-through from lower energy prices has been offset by other factors, mainly captured by quarterly fixed effects. interact with monetary policy actions, affecting the dynamics of inflation, expectations, and eco- nomic activity. The analysis extends the standard dynamic sto- chastic general equilibrium model with expectational learning by Alvarez and Dizioli (2023). The model includes price and wage Phillips curves (relating price and wage inflation to expectations, the gap between real wages and productivity, and economic slack), an IS curve (relating output to the nomi- nal interest rate and inflation expectations), and a monetary policy reaction function. 17 T wo new features are incorporated into the model. First, heterogenous agents or a mix of backward- and forward-looking learners with different information sets are added. Backward-looking learners form their expectations based on their recent experience, whereas forward-looking learners form their expecta- tions rationally based on full information about the 17See Online Annex 2.5 for more details about the model, its structure, and its estimation.

This means that forward-looking learners will behave more like backward-looking learners as the share of backward-looking learners rises in the economy. 18 Second, as inspired by Blanchard and Bernanke (2023), near-term expectations are influ- enced by long-term expectations and vice versa. The main additional assumption is that long-term expec- tations have an impact on inflation only through their effect on near-term expectations. An alternative model allowing only forward-looking learners is also considered for comparison. The two models— heterogenous expectations and forward-looking learners or rational expectations only—are esti- mated for two representative economies (advanced and emerging market) to help capture the struc- tural differences between the two economy groups. With heterogenous agents, the estimated shares of backward-looking learners are about 20 per cent for the advanced economy and about 30 per cent for the emerging market economy, with the remainder being forward-looking learners. More Backward-Looking Learners Prolong Inflation and Weaken Monetary Policy Transmission The propagation of shocks to the economy depends upon how expectations are formed. Following an identical cost-push shock (for example, a surprise rise in energy and commodity prices, an unantici- pated supply chain disruption raising input costs, or other supply-side shocks), inflation is persistently higher when there are heterogenous agents in the economy, as compared with an economy that has only forward-looking learners. With a share of backward-looking learners in the economy, inflation expectations respond more to a cost-push shock and are stickier. Backward-looking learners assume that higher current inflation means that future inflation will be persistently higher. This prolongs the price pressures compared with those in the economy with forward-looking learners who know that the cost-push shock is transitory and do not change their inflation expectations much (Figure 2.10, 18Other expectations formation processes are possible (for exam- ple, completely anchored, unresponsive inflation expectations). The chapter does not aim to be exhaustive. It illustrates instead how a plausible mix of two highly relevant kinds of processes may affect developments. panels 1–4). Moreover, with heterogenous agents, monetary policy has less power initially to influence inflation (Figure 2.10, panels 5–8). The main reason is that backward-looking learners do not consider the impact of monetary policy on future marginal costs, unlike forward-looking learners. Without this forward-looking component, monetary policy can influence expectations only through its direct effects on the output gap. Higher Sacrifice Ratio with More Backward-Looking Learners or Higher Inflation The combination of more prolonged inflationary episodes following a cost-push shock and less pow- erful monetary policy implies that achieving a given level of inflation reduction over a given period will be more costly in terms of output forgone. This will be reflected in the level of the sacrifice ratio, defined here as the percentage of output forgone to achieve a 1 per centage point faster reduction in the inflation rate over a three-year period (Figure 2.11).19 First, the sacrifice ratio is larger in the heterogeneous agents’ model than in the rational expectations model with only forward-looking learners (regardless of the economy group). The main reason for this increased sacrifice ratio is the weaker inflation expec- tations channel for monetary policy when there are more backward-looking learners in the economy. Second, the sacrifice ratio also tends to be higher for an emerging market than an advanced economy, as the former is estimated to have a higher share of backward-looking learners. Third, when there are heterogenous agents, the economy’s dynamics become state dependent. In a high-inflation environ- ment, backward-looking learners behave as though inflation will be permanently higher, entailing a slight endogenous inflation de-anchoring and making monetary policy’s job harder (Figure 2.11, rightmost bars). 20 19T etlow (2022) reports a wide range of sacrifice ratio estimates for advanced economies, with a mode of seven (similar to that presented here) across 40 different models and slightly different definitions. That said, the chapter’s focus is on the qualitative com- parison across cases. 20T o get closer to current conditions, a high-inflation environment is simulated by running the model for eight periods, with inflation 2 per centage points above target, to establish the initial conditions for the scenario. 60 WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: Nav I g a T IN g gLO b a L D I v E R g E NCE s In ternational Monetary Fund | October 2023 Monetary Policy Framework and Communications Improvements Ease Disinflation The estimated model offers a laboratory for consid- ering how alternative policy interventions help hasten a decline in inflation. The first intervention examined is one that would lead to an increase in the share of forward-looking learners in the economy. 21 How might such a shift be achieved? 21Several studies over the past several years indicate that most individ- uals do not understand the central bank’s role in the economy and how policy rate changes affect the economy, suggesting that their expectations may be distorted. See, among others, Coibion, Gorodnichenko, and Weber (2022), ECB (2021), Kumar and others (2015), and van der Cruijsen, Jansen, and de Haan (2015). Andre and others (2022) find that over a sample of 6,500 US households, households on average believe that a rise in a central bank’s policy interest rate would increase inflation. Recent studies suggest that improvements in mone- tary policy frameworks—encompassing central banks’ independence and transparency and their communi- cations strategies—can increase agents’ attention to and understanding of monetary policy actions, helping to make inflation expectations more forward looking (Coibion and others 2020; Carotta, Mello, and Ponce 2023). Brazil’s recent decision to adopt a continuous (rather than calendar year) 3 per cent inflation rate target from 2025 onward is a concrete example of an improve- ment in operational effectiveness and communications strategy, helping to reduce uncertainty and enhance monetary policy effectiveness. Additional examples of improvements in communications strategies include actions since 2020 by the central banks of Pakistan Heterogeneous expectations model Rational expectations model Figure 2.10. Macroeconomic Responses to Shocks Conditional on Agents’ Expectations Formation (Percentage points) Following a cost-push shock, inﬂation expectations are more sensitive when the economy has a mix of forward- and backward-looking learners (heterogenous expectations) than when it has only forward-looking learners (rational expectations). Inﬂation is also more persistent. Monetary policy is less effective, as backward-looking learners do not take account of the effects of interest rate rises on future marginal costs.

Additional examples of improvements in operational effectiveness include decisions since 2019 by the central banks of Chile and Thailand to state their primary policy objective as price stability, with clearly defined numerical targets. Through the lens of the model, the chapter quantifies the potential effects of such interventions in a stylized, illustrative manner. Moreover, an association exists between the qualities of the monetary policy framework in an economy and the likelihood that a simple forecast rationality test of mean inflation expectations is rejected (Figure 2.12; see also Online Annex 2.5). When monetary policy frame- works are weaker (in terms of central bank indepen- dence, transparency, and communications), the share of economies in which forecast rationality of expec- tations is rejected tends to be higher, consistent with a greater incidence of backward-looking learners. 22 22The monetary policy framework indicators come from Unsal, Papageorgiou, and Garbers (2022). See also Box 2.2. Further bolstering the evidence on the importance of the soundness of monetary policy frameworks, a nega- tive association exists between the size of deviations of near-term inflation expectations (or realized inflation rates) from targets and the quality of monetary policy frameworks. As monetary policy frameworks improve, the deviations from target are smaller, implying that inflation comes back to target more quickly, on average (see Online Annex 2.7). Although there has been a notable trend toward improving frameworks in emerging market and develop- ing economies (Box 2.2), the quality of monetary policy frameworks and communications is higher, on average, in advanced economies than in emerging market and Advanced economies Emerging market economies Figure 2.11. Sacriﬁce Ratios under Alternative Expectations Processes (Percent of output forgone to lower inﬂation by 1 percentage point) Sacriﬁce ratios are larger when economies include a mix of forward- and backward-looking learners (heterogenous expectations), as monetary policy is less effective in that case. Emerging market economies tend to have higher shares of backward-looking learners, pushing up their ratios. Higher prevailing inﬂation slightly worsens the ratio, as backward-looking learners raise their expectations. 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 Rational-expectations model Heterogenous- expectations model Heterogenous- expectations model with high inﬂation Source: IMF staff calculations.

As such, the analysis of the policy intervention considers a decline in the share of backward-looking learners in the economy equal to the difference between the share of backward-looking learners in the representative emerging market versus that in the representative advanced economy. 23 With a higher share of forward-looking learners, the same monetary policy tightening path as under the baseline would have stronger effects on inflation expectations (Figure 2.13, panels 1, 3, and 5). Monetary policy is more effective not only because forward-looking learners understand the impacts on future marginal costs, but also because they know that that there is a lower share of backward-looking learners in the economy and hence become even more forward looking. These results are consistent with findings highlighted in Box 2.1, in which US monetary policy is found to be more effective in shaping expectations when firms are more attentive to monetary policy than the average firm in the sector and therefore are more forward looking. The faster trans- mission to inflation expectations translates into a lower realized inflation path and importantly a softer landing, with only small additional output costs. In contrast, even tighter cyclical policies (either monetary or fiscal) as additional interventions also help dampen inflation and expectations, but come with larger output costs (Figure 2.13, panels 2, 4, and 6). While the two cyclical policy interventions are not strictly comparable, they both work in part through generating lower aggregate demand initially. 24 Over time, then, the inflation-lowering effects of tighten- ing feed into inflation expectations, further lowering realized inflation. Although an improvement in monetary policy framework and communications comes with mark- edly lower output costs due to its primary impacts on expectations and their formation, difficulties in implementing these interventions in a timely and effec- tive manner mean that they are not silver bullets and should be seen as complementary to usual monetary policy actions. 23The difference in the share of backward-looking learners is about 8 per cent. 24Specifically, the illustration assumes standard unit policy inter- ventions on impact, with policy persistence properties that differ across the fiscal and monetary interventions, as described in the note to Figure 2.13. Learning dynamics in the model also imply that the evolution of the system can depend on the specific properties of the intervention, as well as the prevailing context.

Policy Interventions to Hasten the Reduction of Inﬂation and Inﬂation Expectations (Percentage point, deviation from baseline) Improvements in the monetary policy framework and communications strategy that boost the share of forward-looking learners in the economy improve the trade-off between lowering inﬂation and fostering growth through their effects on the expectations channel.

As shown in the empirical analysis in Box 2.2, worse fiscal positions (that is, higher public debt and persistent deficits) can reduce the effectiveness of sounder mon- etary policy frameworks in lowering inflation expecta- tions in emerging market and developing economies. In other words, more sustainable fiscal positions are associated with lower average inflation expectations. Even so, there may be conditions under which fiscal support measures may help to lower inflation or at least smooth out a sharp inflationary shock, as seen in Box 2.3’ s analysis of the fiscal relief measures to offset the energy shock in Europe in 2022. Consumers’ perceived or expected persistence of these measures is critical to how they affect the path of inflation. Monetary Policy Faces Inflation-Output Trade-Offs In the current context in which core inflation in many countries is more persistent than initially expected, an important question policymakers face is the timeline for bringing inflation back to target. This subsection illustrates how a central bank’s optimal choice, one that minimizes a stylized welfare loss function, would vary with its objectives and the prop- erties of the underlying shocks in the context of the illustrative model. The baseline case assumes that the central bank seeks to minimize a function that equally weights the welfare losses from the output gap and inflation target deviations, alongside a smoother policy rate path. 25 In the heterogeneous agents’ model, the central bank under the baseline would opt to calibrate the policy rate path to bring inflation back to target in about four years (Figure 2.14, panel 1).26 If the central bank were to accelerate this process and decided to double the weight of inflation in its objective function, then it would aim for inflation to come back to target in about three years. In a more extreme case in which 25Specifically, the exercise assumes that the central bank minimizes a welfare loss function that values interest rate smoothing and equally weights output and inflation deviations (a quadratic loss function). The central bank is also assumed to know the expectations formation process in the economy and to have full information on the path of future cost-push shocks. See Online Annex 2.7 for more details on the exercise. 26Since shock persistence is highly uncertain, this subsection presents two scenarios assuming different degrees of persistence. If the shock turns out to be less persistent, monetary policy will be able to bring inflation back to target in less than four years (Figure 2.14, panel 2). the central bank cares only about inflation, it would choose to bring inflation back to target in two years. However, this latter choice entails lower welfare if society in fact values equally both minimal output gaps and inflation target deviations (Figure 2.14, panel 2).27 27The welfare losses clearly depend on the weights that each soci- ety would put on inflation target and output gap deviations. Heterogeneous-agent model Rational-expectations model Figure 2.14. Policy Objectives, Social Welfare, and Expectations Formation After a cost-push shock, the time it takes inﬂation to get back to target in an economy depends on the formation of expectations and the central bank’s objectives. A greater share of backward-looking learners in the economy draws out the timeline, regardless of policy objectives. A comparison with a stylized social welfare function suggests that a faster path may come with costs unless driven by less persistent shocks. 1.

Note: The ﬁgure assumes that a cost-push shock raises inﬂation 2 percentage points above target initially. The shock has an estimated half-life of 14 quarters. In the baseline scenario, the central bank’s policy seeks to minimize welfare loss, as measured by a stylized social welfare function. The latter includes an interest rate smoothing term and weighs output gap and inﬂation deviations equally. Panel 2 welfare baselines differ by the expectations formation process. For an identical welfare function, social welfare is about 20 percent higher with rational than with heterogenous expectations, reﬂecting enhanced policy effectiveness and lower endogenous persistence of shocks. See Online Annex 2.5 for further details on the assumed objective and social welfare functions and other aspects of the dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model. The “Less persistent shock” scenario reduces the half-life of the shock to 6.5 quarters. 64 WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: Nav I g a T IN g gLO b a L D I v E R g E NCE s In ternational Monetary Fund | October 2023 Finally, if there were only forward-looking learners in the economy, then it would be optimal to bring infla- tion back to target in about three years. Overall, even if the cost-push shock were half as persistent as under the baseline assumptions, it would still be optimal to wait about two years to bring inflation back to target. All these scenarios show that in the presence of a per- sistent cost-push shock and partially backward-looking expectations, it may be optimal to use a more extended timeline over which inflation is brought to target. Conclusions Near-term inflation expectations rose sharply in many economies amid the economic recovery from the pandemic and after the large cost-push shocks of 2022 (from the surprise rises in energy and commodity prices and supply chain disruptions). The rise in expectations was broadly synchronous across professional forecasters, financial markets, households, and firms. In contrast, long-term expectations have remained broadly stable, on average, with no signs of de-anchoring. Past episodes with jointly rising near- and long-term inflation expecta- tions over a sustained period indicate it took about three years on average for inflation and near-term expectations to return to pre-episode levels, although there has been wide variability across episodes. An estimated hybrid Phillips curve suggests that near-term inflation expectations play a more prominent role in explaining current inflation than long-term expectations. Over recent quarters, the driv- ers of inflation have shifted from underlying cost-push shocks toward inflation expectations, particularly for the average advanced economy. For the average emerging market economy, expectations play a smaller role than lagged inflation, but still a significant one. This is particularly relevant because the pass-through of expectations to inflation increases when inflation is already elevated, as it is in the present time. More generally, the analysis underlines the critical role of the expectations formation process for inflation dynamics and the conduct of monetary policy. With a larger share of backward-looking learners in the econ- omy, mean expectations are more persistent and can get stuck at a higher level when inflation is higher for a sustained period. This stickiness reduces the potency of monetary policy and increases the sacrifice ratio (or cost in terms of output forgone) compared with a case in which expectations are purely forward looking. Given the greater inflation persistence implied by having a share of backward-looking learners in the economy, it could take up to four years to get inflation back to its target if central banks equally weigh the welfare losses from inflation deviating from target with those from output gaps. If central banks were to disre- gard the output gap effects of their actions and tighten more and faster, the analysis suggests they could bring inflation back to target in two years, but at the cost of lower output. Taken together, the chapter’s results and recent findings suggest that monetary policymakers benefit from having a clear understanding of the nature of expectations processes at play in their economies. Improved data on expectations could involve close monitoring and enhanced collection of information on expectations across economic agents, particularly near-term expectations which appear more important for current inflation dynamics. The performance of a novel measure of firms’ inflation expectations derived from text analysis of firms’ earnings calls presented in this chapter points to how technological developments have made it more feasible and cost-effective to extract timely information on expectations. Improvements to monetary policy frameworks— particularly those that enhance central bank indepen- dence and transparency—and communication strategies have the scope to boost the share of forward-looking learners in the economy and thereby the effectiveness of monetary policy (Dincer, Eichengreen, and Geraats 2022). Recent literature suggests that exposure to news improves the precision of perceptions and expectations, increases confidence, and lowers dispersion of beliefs (Lamla and Vinogradov 2019). Haldane, Macaulay, and McMahon (2020) recommend that central bank com- munications strategies should start with the three Es: explanation, engagement, and education. Focusing on household and firms, other recent contributions suggest addressing inattention by taking account of audience segmentation and using sources of communication that have been identified as most relevant for people with more backward-looking expectations—for exam- ple, television in the United States and euro area (see Coibion and others 2020, D’Acunto and others 2020, and Weber and others 2022, among others). They also suggest shaping messages that are simple and repeated often, investing in financial literacy education, empha- sizing the goal and not the instruments (for example, former European Central Bank President Mario Draghi’s 2012 “whatever it takes” speech), and targeting the mes- sage to the conjuncture. These communication strategies can help economic agents become aware of, understand, and internalize the effects of monetary policy decisions. 65 CHAPTER 2 Ma N ag IN g Exp ECT a TION s: I NFL a TION a ND M ONET a Ry pOLIC y In ternational Monetary Fund | October 2023 The inflation expectations channel can improve when firms pay greater attention to monetary policy and develop a stronger understanding of what it means for their business prospects. However, surveys of firms’ infla- tion expectations are scarce and time consuming to imple- ment (Coibion and others 2020). This box introduces a new firm-level index of near-term inflation expectations based on text analysis of firms’ earnings calls and presents preliminary findings on how firms’ attention to inflation can influence the effectiveness of monetary policy. An index of firms’ attention to monetary policy is built in this box using a text analysis of firms’ earnings calls. Details of its construction feature in Albrizio, Dizioli, and Simon (2023) and are similar to those for the firm-level index of inflation expectations, as described in Online Annex 2.6. Specifically, an index for US firms’ attention to the Federal Reserve is con- structed based on the frequency of sentences discussing monetary policy in their earnings call transcripts (see Figure 2.1.1 for an aggregate picture). Dynamic responses are estimated using local pro- jections to assess the effect of a monetary policy shock on a firm’s inflation expectations, conditional on the firm’s attentiveness to monetary policy. 1 Attentiveness by firm is de-meaned by sectoral average attentiveness in the regression. Because of the de-meaning and the inclusion of time fixed effects, the interaction between the monetary policy shock and attention reflects the marginal effect of monetary tightening on a firm’s inflation expectations from its being more attentive. More attentive firms decrease their infla- tion expectations by about 1 per cent of one standard deviation more than the average after four quarters (Figure 2.1.2).2 This corresponds to an amplification of about one-fourth to the sector’s average negative response. The results bolster the chapter’s argument that monetary policy is more effective when monetary policy frameworks and communication strategies help improve agents’ trust in central banks and their under- standing of central banks’ monetary policy decisions. The authors of this box are Silvia Albrizio, Pedro Vitale Simon, and Allan Dizioli. 1The specification includes an interaction between a US mone- tary policy shock measure (from Acosta 2023) and an attention index, firm and time fixed effects, and firm-level controls, based on Ottonello and Windberry (2020). Firm-level controls include sales growth, leverage, employment, total assets, and share of cur- rent assets in total assets. Standard errors are two-way clustered by firms and time. 2The shocks have been scaled to have unit standard deviation. Headline Inﬂation ECFACB (right scale, index) Figure 2.1.1.

Firms’ Inflation Expectations, Attention, and Monetary Policy Effectiveness 66 WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: Nav I g a T IN g gLO b a L D I v E R g E NCE s In ternational Monetary Fund | October 2023 Fiscal imprudence—high levels of public debt to GDP— is generally regarded as having the potential to generate uncertainty and influence inflation expectations by eroding perceptions of monetary policy credibility and independence. 1 That much has been clear since the work of Sargent and Wallace (1981) and Leeper (1991). This box empirically examines how the level of inflation expectations is related to an economy’s monetary policy framework, given the level of public debt. In the study presented in this box, the soundness of monetary policy frameworks is captured by a new index, the IAPOC index, developed by Unsal, Papageorgiou, and Garbers (2022). 2 It shows that even after economy-specific controls and time-invariant characteristics are accounted for, higher public debt is associated with expectations of higher inflation, given a specific level of monetary policy framework (Figure 2.2.1, panel 1).3 This heightened impact is even more evident when the focus is on the stock of public debt in foreign currency and exacerbated when fiscal deficits are persistent (Figure 2.2.1, panel 2). However, as monetary policy frameworks are improved (as seen with the shift in the IAPOC index distribu- tion in emerging market and developing economies over the past 15 years), inflation expectations become less sensitive to the level and composition of public debt or persistent fiscal deficits. Overall, the study findings indicate that difficulties posed by higher public debt levels for managing infla- tion expectations in emerging market and developing economies could be eased by adopting strong monetary policy frameworks. Whereas monetary policymaking The authors of this box are Omer Akbal, Mariarosaria Comunale, Marina Conesa Martínez, Chris Papageorgiou, and Filiz Unsal. 1See Brandao-Marques and others (2023) for a recent empir- ical study of the issue and Bianchi and Melosi (2022), Bianchi, Faccini, and Melosi (2022), and Cochrane (2022) for theoreti- cal arguments. 2The IAPOC index and its subindicators quantify the soundness of monetary policy frameworks across countries through three pillars: Independence and Accountability (I and A), Policy and Operational Strategy (P and O), and Communications (C). This comprehensive index enables a multidimensional characterization of monetary policy frameworks—going beyond monetary policy or exchange rate regime classifications—across 13 advanced economies and 37 emerging market and developing economies. See Unsal, Papageorgiou, and Garbers (2022) for further details. The data set has been updated to 2021. 3Advanced economies do not show this differential sensitivity to debt levels over different IAPOC index scores. in many of these economies is better equipped than 15 y ears ago to serve as an anchor of stability, the adop- tion of a prudent fiscal policy approach remains key to effective preparation for challenges and to prevent the risk of fiscal dominance in the future.

Fiscal Imprudence and Inflation Expectations: The Role of Monetary Policy Frameworks 67 CHAPTER 2 Ma N ag IN g Exp ECT a TION s: I NFL a TION a ND M ONET a Ry pOLIC y In ternational Monetary Fund | October 2023 Several European economies have used energy subsidies, tax cuts, and price caps to help smooth the impact of recent shocks to energy prices on incomes and inflation. The effectiveness and desirability of such measures depends on many factors beyond the scope of this box, including their impact on energy markets, resource misallocation, and fiscal sustainability, as well as details of the policy design. One important channel is inflation expectations. T emporary energy subsidies directly lower inflation today but increase it relative to the no-measures scenario after they expire, smoothing the overall inflation path. If energy subsidies are perceived as temporary, the expectations channel may reduce their effectiveness in lowering infla- tion, as expectations of higher future inflation may affect price-setting today. A model from the IMF’s Flexible System of Global Models is used in this box to simulate the impacts on expected and realized inflation of announced energy relief measures (price subsidies and caps) in the euro area. 1 The simulation assumes that the sharp upward shock to energy prices in 2022 is temporary and unwinds. It also includes the indirect effects of energy prices on core inflation through the supply chain. The model estimates that fiscal relief measures lowered euro area inflation by 0.9 per centage point in 2022 and by half a percentage point in 2023 (Figure 2.3.1, panel 1). Although additional fiscal borrowing to finance subsidies boosts demand, its effect on core inflation is more than offset by the reduction in supply-chain costs. These fiscal measures smooth out the inflation impact of the energy shock over time, leading to a rise in inflation over 2024–25 (relative to the no-measures scenario) and preventing an under- shoot as energy subsidies expire and the energy shock unwinds. The measures have a net neutral effect on core inflation expectations in 2022 but increase them by 0.7 per centage point over 2023–24. These find- ings assume, however, that agents fully understand the temporary nature of the subsidies. What if agents misperceive and think that the subsidies will last for a year more than announced? In this alternative scenario, expectations fall more in 2022 (Figure 2.3.1, panel 2). Subsidies also lead firms to lower their The author of this box is Chris Jackson. 1See Dao and others (2023) for further details on the structure of the model and simulation calibration. prices by more in 2022, because they now expect core inflation to be lower in 2023. The fall in inflation expectations increases the impact of fiscal policy on inflation from –0.9 to –1.1 per centage points in 2022 and from –0.5 to –0.6 percentage point in 2023. But once agents realize their error and correct, inflation and expectations bounce back, highlighting the role of the expectations channel.

The baseline in panel 2 assumes ﬁscal relief measures last in 2022 as originally announced. The alternative assumes that households misperceive and expect measures will last longer, but then in 2023 they realize their error and adjust to the announced path. Box 2.3.

International Monetary Fund | October 2023 71 Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 caused major com- modity markets to fragment, and continued geopolitical tensions could make matters worse. This chapter examines the key channels through which further disruptions in commodity trade could affect prices, economic activity, and the clean energy transition. It finds that commod- ity markets are particularly vulnerable in the event of fragmentation. Commodity production is often highly concentrated because of natural endowments, and many commodities are difficult to substitute in the short term. Further fragmentation of commodity markets—which had been on the rise even before the war in Ukraine—could cause large price changes and more price volatility. Model simulations suggest that trade disruptions could result in substantial economic impacts in commodity-dependent economies. However, due to offsetting effects across produc- ing and consuming countries, global economic costs appear modest. Crucially, low-income countries with a high reli- ance on agricultural imports would be disproportionately affected, raising food security concerns. The fragmentation of mineral markets could also make the clean energy transition more costly and lead to lower-than-needed investment in renewable energy and electric vehicles. T aken together, the findings present yet another argument for multilateral cooperation on trade policies. At the very least, agreements on a “green corridor” for critical minerals and a “food corridor” would safeguard the global goals of averting climate change and food insecurity.

Integrated commodity markets have provided cheap inputs that have supported global growth and so have helped raise living standards, especially in emerg- ing markets. 1 However, the war in Ukraine put this process in reverse. For the first time since the 1970s, commodities such as crude oil, natural gas, and wheat were broadly used to exert pressure in a major conflict. Exports were restricted and countersanctions imposed. These disruptions in commodity trade contributed to surging inflation in 2022 in many parts of the world, food insecurity in low-income countries, and slower global growth (IMF 2023). While most commodity prices have since normal- ized, geopolitical tensions signal that more severe fragmentation of commodity trade is a major risk. 2 Many countries are trying to reshore commodity sup- ply chains for national security, geopolitical, or other reasons. Measures include those for critical minerals for clean energy technologies, semiconductors, and defense (examples of actions are the US Inflation Reduction Act, the European Chips Act, and China’s export restrictions on gallium and germanium). As a result, concerns about fragmentation, deglobal- ization, and nearshoring have risen sharply, especially in the commodity sector (Figure 3.1). T ext mining analysis of earnings calls reveals that prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, firms barely mentioned key- words related to fragmentation, but usage surged after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. 1Economic theory suggests that the consumption gains and the more efficient use of resources generated by trade should boost GDP . See Feyrer (2019, 2021) for recent analysis and Irwin (2019) for a review of the literature on trade and growth. 2Building on Aiyar and others (2023), the chapter defines geo- economic fragmentation (referred to as “fragmentation” for brevity in the rest of the chapter) as any policy-driven reversal of integra- tion, including reversals guided by strategic considerations such as national security. It encompasses trade, fiscal and financial measures such as tariffs, export restrictions, subsidies, and restrictions on payments. The trade literature of the early 2000s used “fragmenta- tion” to describe the geographic dispersion of production processes in globally integrated supply chains (Arndt and Kierzkowski 2000; Deardorff 2001). FRAGMENTATION AND COMMODITY MARKETS: VULNERABILITIES AND RISKS 3 CHAPTER WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: Nav I g a T IN g gLO b a L D I v E R g E NCE s 72 In ternational Monetary Fund | October 2023 There is little consensus on the economic costs of fragmentation in the fast-growing literature. Esti- mates of long-term output losses from restricting the international flow of goods and services, finance, and technology range from 0.2 per cent to 12 per - cent of global GDP , depending on the scenario and assumptions. 3 Commodity markets could be another important channel through which further disruptions in trade affect activity. Commodity production is hard to relocate, as it is linked to natural endowments such as geological deposits or soil quality. Consumption of commodities is often difficult to substitute in the short term. Moreover, many commodities are crucial inputs for manufacturing and technologies, including those related to the clean energy transition. Against this backdrop, the chapter studies the main channels through which further fragmentation 3See Aiyar and others (2023) for an overview of potential channels of impact. Recent studies that quantify aggregate losses from restricting trade include Albrizio and others (2023); Attinasi, Boeckelmann, and Meunier (2023); Bolhuis, Chen, and Kett (2023); Fally and Sayre (2018); Felbermayr, Mahlkow, and Sandkamp (2022); Hakobyan, Meleshchuk, and Zymek (2023); and Javorcik and others (2022). Chapter 4 of the April 2023 World Economic Outlook examines the consequences of restrictions on investment, and Chapter 3 of the April 2023 Global Financial Stability Report does the same for portfolio flows, whereas Cerdeiro and others (2021) and Góes and Bekkers (2022) quantify the losses once technological decoupling is also considered. of markets for energy, agricultural, and mineral commodities could affect economies and global public goods—namely, the energy transition. It focuses on the following questions: • What makes commodity markets vulnerable in the event of fragmentation? • I s there fragmentation in commodity markets, and if so, what form does it take? • Which commodities are most vulnerable to disrup- tions in international trade? • What would be the economic impact of commodity market fragmentation across blocs and countries, as well as on the global economy? • What might be the implications of such fragmenta- tion for the clean energy transition? The chapter covers nearly all countries and focuses on 48 commodities, including agricultural goods, energy commodities—namely, coal, crude oil, and natural gas—and other mineral commodities. It builds a unique database of commodity output, use, and bilateral trade, and employs a combination of descriptive statistics, empirical analysis, and model simulations. The chapter simulates a highly stylized risk scenario, in which commodity trade between two geopolitical blocs is persistently disrupted, to illustrate the chan- nels through which commodity market fragmentation could affect prices and output. The main scenario defines the two theoretical blocs by using the 2022 United Nations (UN) vote on the war in Ukraine as a transparent starting point. However, the chapter exam- ines alternative scenarios, including the role of neutral countries and the impact of countries’ switching blocs, given the sensitivity of the analysis to bloc configura- tions and the difficulty of assessing bloc configurations’ plausibility. 4 4Countries’ geopolitical alignment could be partly driven by trade linkages and risk management strategies to reduce the fallout from spikes in geopolitical tensions. However, the endogenous formation of blocs remains beyond the scope of the chapter. The two-bloc scenario presented here is meant to provide a clearly defined baseline and to make the exercise comparable to those in the recent literature. Introducing neutral countries reduces the impact of fragmentation, as discussed later in the chapter. Online Annex 3.1 provides details on the commodities and coun- tries and their allocation across blocs as well as data sources. Online Annex 3.5.2 discusses the robustness of some of the key findings to different bloc configurations. All online annexes are available at www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO.

Fragmentation Keywords in Earnings Calls (Indices, 2013–15 = 100) CHAPTER 3 F R a g MENT a TION a ND C OMMODIT y Ma RKET s : vULNER ab ILITIE s a ND R I s K s 73International Monetary Fund | October 2023 The main findings are as follows: • Commodities are vulnerable in the event of fragmen- tation. The importance of natural endowments for production can lead to high geographic concen- tration of output. For example, the three biggest suppliers of minerals account for about 70 per cent of global production, on average. Coupled with low demand elasticities and their upstream use in many manufacturing processes and key technologies, this means that commodities are highly traded. However, many importers rely on just a few suppliers. These features raise the cost of trade disruptions. • Ther e is rising fragmentation in commodity markets. Measures restricting commodity trade surged in 2022, much more than those restricting trade in other goods. For selected commodities, price differentials across geographic markets have widened. And commodity sector foreign direct investment (FDI) and cross-border mergers and acquisitions were on the decline even prior to the war in Ukraine. • F ragmentation could cause large price changes. The scale of the price effects depends on the supply-and-demand imbalances caused by frag- mentation and the price elasticities of supply and demand. Illustrative partial equilibrium model simulations suggest that price effects could be particularly strong for some minerals critical for the green transition and some highly traded agricultural goods. Spikes in agricultural commodity prices could be concerning for many low-income countries reliant on imports to feed their population. • F ragmented commodity markets would also lead to higher price volatility. Smaller markets in a fragmented world would provide fewer buffers against commodity supply and demand shocks, leading to larger price responses than under free trade. Moreover, commodity producers would have powerful incentives to switch allegiances given potentially significant differences in com- modity prices among blocs. This would induce more supply shocks, volatility, and uncertainty in commodity markets, challenging fiscal, monetary, and financial stability. • F or many commodity-dependent economies, fragmenta- tion would lead to sizable macroeconomic impacts. For some low-income countries and emerging market economies, illustrative trade model simulations point to long-term output losses exceeding 2 per cent. Due to vastly different and often offsetting impacts across net commodity-producing and net commodity-consuming countries, however, economic losses appear relatively modest at the global level. This should not lead to complacency: the chapter quantifies only the restriction of commodity trade between blocs. Should the world fragment into isolated blocs, the flows of other goods and services, finance, technology, and know-how would most likely also be disrupted, amplifying global economic costs (Aiyar and others 2023). The higher volatility and uncertainty brought on by commodity market fragmentation would complicate policymaking and add to costs, a channel that is also not captured. Moreover, within countries, offsetting effects on commodity consumers and producers imply strong distributional impacts even absent large aggre- gate output effects. Fragmentation in agricultural commodity markets could raise food insecurity in low-income countries, with high social and human- itarian costs that are not included in the chapter’s model simulations. In sum, commodity market fragmentation could deliver a sizable economic blow in an already challenging environment of slow global growth, tight financial conditions, and high debt in many vulnerable countries. • F ragmentation in mineral markets could make the clean energy transition more costly. Demand for critical minerals is projected to rise severalfold in a net-zero-carbon-emissions scenario. These min- erals are highly concentrated geographically, and their elasticities of demand and supply are low, so trade disruptions could add to upward pressure on mineral prices in the bloc where demand exceeds supply after fragmentation. But the mineral-rich bloc cannot reap the benefits from oversupply, as refining capacity cannot be scaled up quickly. In the illustrative simulation, fragmentation results in up to 30 per cent lower-than-needed investment in renewables and electric vehicles (EVs) at the global level by 2030. What Makes Commodities Vulnerable in the Event of Fragmentation? This section documents several features of commod- ity markets that would raise the economic costs of disrupting their trade, despite commodities’ homoge- neity and fungibility. WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: Nav I g a T IN g gLO b a L D I v E R g E NCE s 74 In ternational Monetary Fund | October 2023 Production Concentration The first production stage of commodities depends on natural endowments, which can be heavily concen- trated geographically. For instance, the extraction of minerals and energy commodities requires cost-effective geological deposits. Availability of fertile soil, water, and an adequate climate can constrain agricultural produc- tion and yields. As a result, the three largest-producing countries account for about 65 per cent of the global output of agriculture, about 50 per cent of that of energy, and about 70 per cent of that of mineral commodities on average (Figure 3.2, panel 1).5 Minerals represent a special case: production is concentrated both at the first stage (mining) because of the geographic concentration of deposits, and also at the second (processing) stage. Relocating production at the mining stage may be impossible over the short and medium term, given the importance of natural endowments. Elasticities of Supply and Demand The price elasticity of supply, which measures how output responds to price changes, is relatively low for commodities in the short term (Figure 3.2, panel 2). Scaling up production requires large investments, environmental permitting, and community consulta- tions that can delay a supply response to price changes. For example, it takes on average 16 years from explo- ration to the opening of copper mines (IEA 2021). Discovering new deposits is also costly and takes time. 6 5The chapter focuses on countries and not firms. Commodity extraction is often undertaken by multinationals or firms owned by foreign investors (Leruth and others 2022). Firm-level concentra- tion could be different from country-level concentration. However, governments are typically the ultimate owners of land or reserves and lease them to firms for a limited time. Renegotiations of lease terms as well as expropriations are common (Jaakkola, Spiro, and Van Benthem 2019). The chapter also focuses on production rather than reserves owing to lack of data availability. Reserves and production are highly correlated (USGS 2023). Online Annex 3.2 provides the production and import con- centration and the share of trade in output for the commodities. Concentration of production is also apparent at the firm level, with a few countries taking stakes in key firms (Leruth and others 2022). 6Elasticities below 1 are generally considered low. See Fally and Sayre (2018) and Dahl (2020) for a literature review on supply and demand elasticities across commodities. Arezki, van der Ploeg, and T oscani (2019) analyze the responsiveness of resource discoveries to market incentives. It is worth noting that the sizable investments needed to expand the supply of commodities may be hindered by the disruptions in external capital flows and higher uncertainty that geoeconomic frag- mentation might trigger, as discussed in the April 2023 World Economic Outlook and April 2023 Global Financial Stability Report. Setting up processing capacity comes with its own challenges, such as regulations; access to know-how, technology, and skilled labor; infrastructure require- ments; and labor costs (IEA 2023). These help explain the geographic concentration at the refining and pro- cessing stages. On the demand side, many commodities are inputs for key technologies and products or are essential to household consumption (food, heating, cooking, and transportation are examples). Disruptions to their supply can cause ripple effects across sectors and value chains. As upstream inputs for the production of a vast array of goods and services (Figure 3.2, panel 3), they are often hard to substitute, and demand responds little to swings in prices. This is reflected in their low price elasticity of demand, particularly in the short term. Importance of Trade With production highly concentrated and demand often broadly spread across countries, commodities are heavily traded. Their homogeneity and fungibility— despite low demand and supply elasticities, com- modities have a high elasticity of substitution across suppliers—also contribute to market integration. The share of production traded internationally is higher for most commodities than the ratio of world trade to gross output (Figure 3.2, panel 4). On average across agricultural and energy commodities, about 30 percent of output is dedicated to trade and about 45 percent for minerals, with the shares substantially higher for many commodities. 7 As a result, imports satisfy a large part of the demand for commodities. However, many countries depend on only a handful of suppliers (Figure 3.2, panel 5). For example, roughly half of the world’s countries rely on three or fewer exporting countries for their imports of minerals, and a quarter on only one. This leaves them vulnerable to supply disruptions in the near term. 8 7Even though commodities are heavily traded, their share in global trade has declined as trade liberalization, lower transportation costs, and cross-border production chains have supported the rapid rise in intermediate-goods trade. The share of primary goods in total goods trade declined from roughly 45 per cent in the first half of the 20th century to about 13 per cent in 2019–21 (Online Annex Figure 3.2.4). 8Historically, countries were often able to adapt to trade disrup- tions over the medium to long term by finding alternative suppliers, because of commodities’ homogeneity, or by developing substitutes (see Box 3.2). CHAPTER 3 F R a g MENT a TION a ND C OMMODIT y Ma RKET s : vULNER ab ILITIE s a ND R I s K s 75International Monetary Fund | October 2023 Import dependence in agricultural commodities can lead to food insecurity in case of trade disrup- tions, particularly in low-income countries. For instance, the average low-income country imports more than 80 per cent of the wheat it consumes. Given low storage capacity, consumption smooth- ing can be difficult in these countries, exposing populations to large swings in prices or food short- ages (Figure 3.2, panel 6). The ramifications of food commodity shocks, which have been linked to social unrest, conflict, and migration (Kelley and others 2015; M issirian and Schlenker 2017; Burke and McGuirk 2020), go beyond the economic analysis that follows.

Commodities: Key Characteristics WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: Nav I g a T IN g gLO b a L D I v E R g E NCE s 76 In ternational Monetary Fund | October 2023 Sensitivity to Geopolitics Analysis of trade patterns suggests that commodity trade is historically associated with countries’ geopolitical alignment. Gravity equations, estimated for the commodi- ties in the sample and augmented to include the similarity between countries’ portfolios of military alliances, show that bilateral commodity trade flows are negatively associ- ated with military distance ( F igure 3.3).9 However, notable differences are apparent in the strength of the relationship across types of commodities: a one-standard-deviation increase in the distance of military alliances (approximately the distance between India and Morocco in 2018) is 9The gravity model is widely used to explain bilateral trade flows based on country and country pair characteristics that capture trading costs, such as geographic distance or a common border, lan- guage, or currency. Online Annex 3.3 provides details and robustness checks. Distance in military alliances is associated with lower trade in minerals across specifications. The results are more sensitive for other measures of geopolitical alignments, namely, the ideal point distance based on UN votes, used in Chapter 4 of the April 2023 World Economic Outlook in a similar analysis for FDI flows (see also Jaku- bik and Ruta 2023). Hakobyan, Meleshchuk, and Zymek (2023) examine distance in military alliances and sectoral trade flows. associated with a decrease in trade in energy commodities by about 15 per cent but it is associated with a more than 35 percent decline in minerals trade. The exercise suggests that changes in military alliances because of rising geopo- litical tensions could go hand in hand with disruptions of trade flows and fuel fragmentation of commodity trade. Fragmentation in Commodity Markets This section takes stock of various measures of fragmentation. The number of new interventions in commodity trade has risen every year since 2018, with the increase initially fueled by tensions between China and the United States and the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2022, Russia’s war in Ukraine caused a major spike in new trade restrictions for commodities: there were more than six times more new restrictions affecting trade in commodities in 2022 than the 2016–19 aver- age. In contrast, trade-restricting measures on overall trade increased 3.5 times ( F igure 3.4, panel 1).10 Price dispersion across locations can also be a symp- tom of fragmentation: as commodities are homoge- neous goods, they should trade under one price after transportation costs are accounted for. However, price dispersion increased in major commodity markets in 2022, especially in those for some minerals, such as lithium, and energy commodities (Figure 3.4, panel 2). F or example, Russian coal traded at a price almost three times lower than Australian coal in September 2022. Price dispersion for crude oil and natural gas also rose as the war in Ukraine and associated sanc- tions disrupted trade. Box 3.1 documents shifts in trade flows using real-time vessel-tracking data. Other proxies for fragmentation are changes in the number of FDI projects and cross-border mergers and acquisitions, which are also indicators of future trade. They were declining in the energy and mineral sectors even before the war in Ukraine, which could presage a slowdown in commodity trade (Figure 3.4, panel 3).11 Shifts have also occurred in the origin and destination 10T rade interventions in the Global T rade Alert database, the source for the data in Figure 3.4, panel 1, include both measures that increase fragmentation, such as import tariffs and export restric- tions, and measures that aim to limit the economic fallout from fragmentation by encouraging diversification, such as subsidies for local producers, local-content requirements, and the like—although a strict distinction between the two is difficult. 11Following Chapter 4 of the April 2023 World Economic Outlook, the analysis focuses on the number rather than the value for FDI and cross-border mergers and acquisitions. Data on values are limited and often estimated. However, FDI values suggest a similar decline in the commodity sector. Figure 3.3.

US and EU investors are increasingly tar- geting projects in advanced economies, whereas China and Russia have increased their investments in Africa (see Online Annex Figure 3.2.5).12 12Chapter 4 of the April 2023 World Economic Outlook documents FDI flows are increasingly concentrated among geopolitically aligned countries, particularly in strategic sectors. No measure of fragmentation is perfect. It is still too early to assess how long-lasting price dispersion will be. The decline in FDI could reflect moder- ation in commodity prices since 2015, following the decade-long commodity boom, and it is not clear, on account of lagging data, to what extent trade-restricting measures have affected trade flows (Goldberg and Reed 2023). However, taken together, these measures suggest rising commodity market fragmentation. Which Commodities Are Most Vulnerable? T o assess individual commodities’ vulnerability in the event of fragmentation, this section presents results from a single-commodity, multicountry partial equilibrium model based on Alvarez and others (2023) (see also Online Annex 3.4 for details). It computes price changes that would occur if trade for each of the 48 commodities included in the analysis were banned across two blocs. For illustrative purposes, the main scenario assumes that the two theoretical blocs are constructed based on the 2022 UN vote on Russia’s war in Ukraine. The bloc comprising countries that voted for Russia to withdraw from Ukraine is labeled the “US-Europe+ bloc”; the remaining countries are in the “China-Russia+ bloc.” 13 The exercise assumes, in a highly stylized and extreme way, that there is no trade in a particular commodity between blocs, whereas intrabloc trade of the commodity is unaf- fected. Box 3.2 discusses more fluid experiences of fragmentation; investigating the impacts of those intermediate scenarios is beyond the scope of the chapter. Rather, the chapter’s goal is to identify rela- tive vulnerabilities across commodity markets and to illustrate transmission channels, with the recognition that partial interactions between blocs and arbi- trage opportunities could mute the economic effects implied by the model simulations. For each commodity, the model’s initial calibra- tion is based on observed 2019 trade flows. They are assumed to reflect an integrated world, where goods are traded at one global price. 14 The trade ban across 13See also Chapter 3 of the October 2022 Regional Economic Outlook: Asia and Pacific. More details on the countries in each bloc and sensitivity checks for other bloc configurations are in Alvarez and others (2023) and Online Annexes 3.1.2 and 3.5.2. 14The assumption of perfect trade integration in the baseline over- simplifies reality, as markets for some commodities were not perfectly integrated globally even before the war in Ukraine.

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: Nav I g a T IN g gLO b a L D I v E R g E NCE s 78 In ternational Monetary Fund | October 2023 blocs yields bloc-specific prices that clear bloc-level supply and demand. Fragmentation would induce opposite price effects across blocs. The price of a commodity falls in the bloc that used to be a net exporter of that commodity and increases in the net importing bloc. The size of price changes depends on (1) bloc-level supply-and-demand imbalances prior to fragmentation—that is, the extent to which a bloc relies on imports to satisfy its demand at the integrated world price—and (2) the capacity of demand and supply to respond to changing prices (the price elasticities of demand and supply). Commodities with inelastic demand and supply and with high imbal- ances across blocs are more vulnerable to price changes. 15 Model simulations suggest that the potential price impact of fragmentation would vary significantly across commodities, with some potentially experiencing very large price increases (Figure 3.5; see Online Annex Figure 3.5.1 for the underlying commodity-specific results).16 In the China-Russia+ bloc, the price of mined minerals, including cobalt, lithium, copper, and nickel, which are critical for the green transition, would rise substantially. Production of these miner- als would be concentrated in a handful of countries in the US-Europe+ bloc, but they are largely used as inputs in the China-Russia+ bloc (see Online Annex F igure 3.2.6). At the same time, the US-Europe+ bloc could experience similar increases in the prices of refined minerals, which are processed mostly in China, Russia, and South Africa. In contrast, the potential price changes for energy and most agricultural commodities are more subdued in the main simulation. Since the production of these commodities is less geographically concentrated, supply and demand are more balanced across the two blocs. However, palm oil and soybean represent two important outliers: more than 80 per cent of produc- tion would occur in the US-Europe+ bloc, whereas most of the consumption would take place in the China-Russia+ bloc. Because of high geographic concentration, the vulnerability of commodities in the event of fragmenta- tion depends on the distribution of key exporters (and importers) across blocs. Simulations based on different 15The exercise does not explicitly model storage, which is an important feature of volatility smoothing. See among others, Williams (1936), Gustafson (1958), and Wright and Williams (1982). Carter, Rausser, and Smith (2011) provide a literature review. 16The following partial equilibrium results are based on Alvarez and others (2023). country compositions of the two hypothetical blocs, described in Online Annex 3.5.2, suggest that, in a way similar to what occurs in the main simulation, fragmenta- tion would lead to significant price increases for minerals at the mining stage and for key agricultural staples (such as soybeans) in the China-Russia+ bloc. In an alternative bloc scenario, in which all emerging market and devel- oping economies, excluding India, Indonesia, and Latin American countries, are assigned to the China-Russia+ bloc, the US-Europe+ bloc could experience large price increases for some minerals. This is because key producers are allocated to the other bloc. It could also become more vulnerable in case of trade restrictions on some agricul- tural commodities (such as cocoa) and crude oil. Higher Commodity Price Volatility Fragmented commodity markets would lead to higher price volatility (see Jacks, O’Rourke, and Williamson 2011, for historical evidence). This would challenge public finances and fiscal and monetary frameworks, giving rise to potential procyclicality of fiscal and monetary policies and hurting economic US-Europe+ China-Russia+ Palm oil, soybean Cobalt, copper, lithium, nickel Figure 3.5.

Fragmentation can affect price volatility through at least two channels: smaller market sizes and countries switching blocs. 17 Smaller Market Sizes In a fragmented world, markets would become smaller and bloc-level prices more responsive to country-level shocks (see also Albrizio and others 2023). In the partial equilibrium model, the price response is proportional to the supply shock’s size rela- tive to the overall market. Thus, by restricting the set of countries with which they trade, countries would face larger price increases in response to the same negative supply shocks. 18 In an illustrative example, Figure 3.6 compares the price impact of a three-standard-deviation shock to the US wheat harvest in an integrated market with that in a fragmented market. 19 The same supply shock doubles the impact on wheat prices when trade is fragmented into two smaller blocs. This is important, as climate change is expected to raise the variability of agricultural output. A fragmented world, in which the price response to supply shocks is amplified, would be less able to cope with this challenge. Countries Switching Blocs In a fragmented world, major commodity producers would face powerful incentives to switch geopolit- ical allegiances, with such switching representing a new source of supply shocks and price volatility. For highly concentrated commodity markets, a single exporting country switching to the other bloc could lead to a large supply gap and trigger hefty price changes. Uncertainty about a country’s geopoliti- cal alignment could itself lead to price volatility as traders update their priors regarding potentially large fragmentation-induced price swings. 17Other channels could include the impact on the financial ecosystem linked to commodities, such as derivatives and insur- ance (FSB 2023). 18In the single-commodity model, the price change in response to a supply shock is Price Change = – Size of Supply Shock Relative to Market ___ Elasticity of Supply − Elasticity of Demand , with Elasticity of Demand < 0 (Alvarez and others 2023). 19The United States accounts for about 7 per cent of global and 15 per cent of US-Europe+ bloc wheat production. A three-standard- deviation US harvest shock corresponds to about 60 per cent of US wheat production, or 4 per cent of global output, with wheat prices held constant. The exercise uses a price elasticity of supply of 0.2 and a price elasticity of demand of –0.85 (see Alvarez and others 2023). Lower elasticities would lead to higher price impacts, and fragmentation would still double the price impact in this example. T o illustrate price sensitivity to countries switching blocs, Figure 3.7 shows the distribution of the great- est price increases each commodity can experience in a bloc when a single exporting country switches its alliance. 20 Minerals at the mining stage tend to be the most sensitive, given their highly concentrated production. For example, South Africa produces one-third of the world’s manganese, a metal used in steelmaking and batteries. If South Africa switched to the US-Europe+ bloc, the price of manganese in the China-Russia+ bloc could rise more than 800 per cent. Economic Impacts of Commodity Market Fragmentation This section sheds light on the macroeconomic impacts of fragmenting commodity markets on individual economies, blocs, and the global economy. Three complementary analytical approaches are used. 21 20These results are based on Alvarez and others (2023). Online Annex Figure 3.5.2 zooms into the results in Figure 3.7 by showing the 15 commodities whose prices are most vulnerable to a single exporter switching blocs and the implied price changes. 21Online Annexes 3.4–3.6; Alvarez and others (2023); and Bolhuis, Chen, and Kett (2023) discuss the assumptions, calibration, and additional results of each model. None of the approaches consider the impact of fragmentation on productivity and innovation. The role of the financial sector is also outside of the scope of the chapter. Figure 3.6.

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: Nav I g a T IN g gLO b a L D I v E R g E NCE s 80 In ternational Monetary Fund | October 2023 First, the partial equilibrium model discussed earlier is leveraged to compute changes in producer and consumer surplus due to fragmentation in individual commodity markets. The resulting change in total sur- plus is used as an indicator of economic impact. This approach identifies the most macro-relevant commodi- ties. It accounts for the changes in price and quantities consumed or produced of each commodity because of fragmentation. However, due to its partial equilibrium nature, the approach does not account for sectoral spillover effects, nor does it allow for the simultane- ous disruption of trade in many commodities, which could have opposing or reinforcing effects within the same country. T wo general equilibrium models in the chapter overcome these shortcomings. A static multicoun- try, multisector trade model, which accounts for all input-output linkages across sectors, is used to simulate the long-term GDP losses associated with fragmenting all commodity trade and to examine the role of neutral blocs (see Box 3.3). Finally, the dynamic effects on GDP and inflation are exam- ined in a multiregion dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model that includes energy and criti- cal minerals. Evidence from the Partial Equilibrium Model Several findings emerge from the partial equilibrium approach. First, inefficiencies associated with restrict- ing trade result in losses in bloc-level total surplus: the global economy is worse off from the fragmentation of trade in individual commodities (see Figure 3.8, panel 1).22 Second, bloc-level changes in total surplus are gen- erally small (with some notable exceptions 23), masking important heterogeneities across countries. Within each bloc, some countries would experience an increase in surplus (net-exporting countries in a net-importing bloc and net-importing countries in a net-exporting bloc), and some experience a decline. Such changes would be small for most countries as a share of gross national expenditure but could be very sizable for a few commodity importers and exporters, as shown in Online Annex Figure 3.5.4. For instance, fragmenta- tion of copper at the mining stage would reduce sur- plus by as much as 2.5 to 5 per cent of gross national expenditure in Chile and Peru, both exporters of copper to the US-Europe+ bloc, in which prices would fall. At the same time, it would lead to large surplus gains in Kazakhstan and Mongolia, which would scale up exports at higher prices to the copper-scarce China-Russia+ bloc ( F igure 3.8, panel 2). Third, restricting trade in commodities that are less price-vulnerable could still generate sizable 22This result and the following are based Alvarez and others (2023). They also provide the analytical proof. In an integrated world, trade patterns reflect the efficient allocation of resources glob- ally, with countries specializing in commodities for which they have comparative advantage (cost-effective deposits or suitable climate conditions). After fragmentation, trade patterns no longer reflect these comparative advantages. 23Online Annex Figure 3.5.3 shows the five largest surplus losses at the bloc level from the fragmentation of a single commodity. Such data points are marked as outliers in Figure 3.8, panel 1, capped at –0.05 per cent of gross national expenditure. In the main simulation, trade fragmentation of palm oil or copper at the mining stage could lead to surplus losses in the China-Russia+ bloc of more than 1 per cent of gross national expenditure, and trade fragmentation of iron ore or soybeans to surplus losses of more than 0.5 per cent.

For example, energy commodities are not particularly vulnerable under the baseline bloc configuration, but the associated declines in surplus would be more significant, because energy commod- ities are widely consumed and produced. In contrast, minerals could experience strong price changes, but the surplus impact would be more subdued, given their (so far) more limited relevance in most countries’ production and consumption. Finally, surplus declines would generally be larger in the hypothetical China-Russia+ bloc. Commodities that are most vulnerable are more broadly consumed in this bloc (Online Annex Figure 3.5.3).24 Evidence from the Trade Model The general equilibrium multicountry, multisector trade model presented in Box 3.3 simulates long-term GDP effects from the disruption of all commodity trade. Broad differences are seen in the impact across countries, with some experiencing sizable losses. Low-income countries could suffer deeper losses, on average estimated at 1.2 percent, given their high dependence on agricultural trade. For some of these countries losses could amount to more than 2 per - cent of GDP . Consistent with the single-commodity exercise, the hypothetical China-Russia+ bloc is more affected by fragmentation, yet the global GDP loss, at roughly 0.3 per cent, is modest as a result of offsetting effects across countries.25 The economic impact can be greatly reduced if commodity trade is only partially restricted. Illustrative simulations, in which countries that abstained from the UN vote on Ukraine are assumed to trade commodi- ties freely, point to much smaller effects of trade bar- riers between the US-Europe+ and the China-Russia+ blocs. Long-term changes in global GDP from this scenario would be negligible, with meaningful losses only in Russia. This is in line with historical evidence on the ability of demand and supply of commodities to adjust in response to trade restrictions (Box 3.2). Evidence from the Dynamic Macroeconomic Model This subsection uses a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium framework to assess the dynamic GDP and inflation effects of commodity fragmentation. The model is based on an augmented version of the 24Sensitivity checks in Online Annex 3.5.2 show that this holds for a bloc configuration based on existing trade relationships. Alter- natively, if all emerging market and developing economies, excluding India, Indonesia, and Latin American countries, are assigned to the China-Russia+ bloc, the US-Europe+ bloc could experience larger surplus losses, mainly on account of oil market disruptions. 25Global GDP losses from restricting commodity flows between blocs constitute about 15 per cent of the loss from restricting all trade. In comparison, commodities represent only 10 per cent of total trade. The larger losses from fragmenting energy and agricultural markets in Bolhuis, Chen, and Kett (2023) stem from the assump- tion of full autarky compared with the no-trade-between-blocs scenario in the chapter.

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: Nav I g a T IN g gLO b a L D I v E R g E NCE s 82 In ternational Monetary Fund | October 2023 IMF’s Global Macroeconomic Model for the Energy T ransition.26 It includes the production, consumption, and trade of energy from fossil and renewable sources as well as four minerals critical to the energy transi- tion. Commodities include crude oil, coal, natural gas, copper, nickel, cobalt, and lithium, capturing about 70 per cent of the value of global commodity trade. Fragmentation is modeled as a ban on trading these commodities between the two hypothetical blocs, which comprise six different regions. In the model, fragmentation affects activity through several channels. First, the trade ban induces expenditure switching and trade diversion. Second, temporary imbal- ances between supply and demand within blocs emerge until prices adjust to clear markets. Such imbalances generate swings in commodity prices. Finally, rigidities affect the speed of adjustment of output, use, and trade, as well as overall macroeconomic effects. The output and inflation effects could vary sig- nificantly across regions, blocs, and commodities (Figure 3.9). Comparison of the impact on individual commodities highlights the channels at play. The effects of fragmenting trade in oil and gas would be quite dif- ferent, even though the distribution of oil and gas con- sumption and production would be similar across blocs. For oil, countries could quickly switch to trading part- ners within their bloc, with limited impact on GDP . By contrast, rigidities such as the need for pipelines or other structures would constrain natural gas trade diversion, with more pronounced effects on GDP . GDP would decline and inflation would increase in both blocs. In the case of minerals, simulations highlight the importance of the geographic distribution of mining production and rigidities in scaling up refining capacity. On the one hand, fragmentation could lead to a steep rise in prices in the China-Russia+ bloc and sizable declines in real GDP . Roughly 80 per cent of the supply of the four minerals is mined in the US-Europe+ bloc, and minerals are used intensively in the China-Russia+ bloc’s sizable manufacturing and construction sector. On the other hand, the US-Europe+ bloc would not be able to benefit from the relative oversupply of minerals at the mining stage because it would take several years to scale 26The model was first used in Chapter 3 of the October 2022 World Economic Outlook. It is augmented here by (1) including the possibility of segmenting tradable energy markets and (2) explicitly modeling two types of mineral aggregates composed of copper and nickel as well as cobalt and lithium, respectively. The augmented model has six regions: the United States, the European Union, US-EU-leaning countries, China, Russia, and China-Russia-leaning countries. up refining capacity. That bloc would also experience a GDP decline from mineral market fragmentation. T rade fragmentation of all seven commodities would be associated with a global GDP loss of about 0.3 per - cent. However, as in the partial equilibrium and trade models, sizable differences are observed across and within blocs. The simulated losses would be larger in the China-Russia+ bloc. Within the US-Europe+ bloc, Europe could experience a sizable impact on inflation (as much as 100 basis points or more) and GDP , with that impact driven mainly by the fragmentation of oil and gas markets. Several caveats are worth highlighting. Whereas the model provides regional granularity, it masks the heterogeneity of effects across countries, given the Energy and minerals Minerals Natural gas Crude oil Figure 3.9.

Second, modeling and data constraints allow for the inclusion of only a subset of commodities. Third, the model does not capture the cost from a more volatile inflationary regime, which could make monetary policy more difficult. Finally, the model, like the two complementary analyses preceding it, uses prepandemic data on mineral usage and trade flows. Given the sizable projected increase in demand for these minerals throughout the green transition, the macroeconomic relevance of disrupting trade in these commodities will probably be greater—as discussed in the next section. Implications for the Clean Energy Transition Fragmentation of commodity markets could affect the cost of decarbonization. Minerals such as cop- per, nickel, cobalt, and lithium are key inputs for the energy transition. They are used in EVs, in batteries and wiring, and in renewable-energy technologies such as solar panels and wind turbines. Demand for these critical minerals could increase substantially (IEA 2023), and they could become as important to the world economy in a net-zero-emissions scenario as crude oil (Boer, Pescatori, and Stuermer 2023). Under the scenario of net zero emissions by 2050, the IEA (2023) projects demand for copper to grow by a factor of 1.5, that for nickel and cobalt to double, and that for lithium to increase six times by 2030. This could raise prices substantially, as mining and refin- ing are hard to scale up and are highly concentrated geographically (Figure 3.2, panel 1; Online Annex Figure 3.2.2). For example, Chile and Peru mine more than a third of the world’s copper, and Indonesia and the Philippines about half its nickel. Using the augmented Global Macroeconomic Model for the Energy T ransition, this section illustrates the potential effects of mineral market fragmentation on energy transition dynamics. 27 The analysis focuses on minerals because they are key inputs for green technol- ogies. The study of fragmentation of other commodity 27Modeling the net effects of fragmentation on innovation and government policies in green technologies, in the more efficient use of commodities, in substitution, and in extraction technologies is beyond the scope of this chapter. There could be competing long-term effects within and across blocs that are not captured by the supply and demand elasticities used in the model (see Acemoglu 2002; Acemoglu and others 2012; Schwerhoff and Stuermer 2020; Hassler, Krusell, and Olovsson 2021; Góes and Bekkers 2022; and Lemoine, forthcoming). markets relevant for the green transition (such as oil and natural gas markets) is left to future research. The analysis uses projected increases in demand for key critical minerals in a net-zero-emissions scenario (IEA 2023), with the projections assuming that policy incentives stimulate investment in renewable-energy technologies and EVs. It first assumes free commodity trade. With policies left unchanged, it then compares the results with those under a counterfactual scenario of complete mineral market fragmentation across the two hypothetical blocs. In the integrated-world baseline, the model indicates that world prices of the four key miner- als considered could rise by about 90 per cent, on average, along the net-zero-emissions-scenario path to 2030. If critical mineral markets are fragmented, the inability of the hypothetical China-Russia+ bloc to import copper, nickel, lithium, and cobalt from countries such as Chile, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Indonesia would lead to an addi- tional price increase in that bloc of 300 percent, on average. Acquiring minerals would be more expensive, which would lead to lower investment in solar panels and wind turbines and fewer EVs (Figure 3.10). In this net zero scenario, there would be about 70 per - cent fewer new EVs in the China-Russia+ bloc in a fragmented world than in an integrated world. 28 Fragmentation would cause an oversupply of min- erals in the hypothetical US-Europe+ bloc. However, the time needed to scale up mineral refining capacity is assumed to constrain the use of minerals in that bloc. Hence, fragmentation generates only small gains in the US-Europe+ bloc, with a slightly higher number of EVs produced, but no gains in renewable-energy capacity, by 2030. On balance, global net investment in renewable technology and production of EVs would be roughly 20 per cent lower compared with the baseline because of mineral market fragmentation.29 This shortfall 28In the fragmentation scenario, China’s fiscal cost of supporting investment in reverting to the net-zero-emissions path would be 1½–2 per cent of GDP . Quantifying the impact of fragmentation on emissions reduction is outside the scope of this chapter. 29These findings are robust to assuming that technological progress would improve the substitutability of minerals with other inputs. Doubling the elasticity of substitution of the four minerals would reduce the decline in investment in renewable technology from 20 per cent to 12 percent, for instance. The shortfall in global green investment because of fragmentation would be more muted, how- ever, if key producers of minerals (Chile, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Peru) were assigned to the China-Russia+ bloc instead. See the exercise on countries switching blocs earlier in the chapter. WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: Nav I g a T IN g gLO b a L D I v E R g E NCE s 84 In ternational Monetary Fund | October 2023 would increase to about 30 per cent if one uses green- house gas emissions to weigh the regional response of investment in renewables and EVs. The measure accounts for the greater emissions intensity of activity in the China-Russia+ bloc and hence the greater effort needed to achieve global emissions mitigation goals. 30 Decarbonizing the world economy would be more difficult if the market for minerals is fragmented. Summary and Policy Implications Commodity markets are an important channel through which geopolitical fragmentation can affect the economy. Many features of commodities underpin their vulnerability in the event of fragmentation: their 30The China-Russia+ bloc accounted for more than half of greenhouse gas emissions in 2020, but only a third of global GDP . Hence, global investment losses are significantly larger when bloc-level changes are aggregated using emissions (the yellow dots in Figure 3.10) rather than purchasing-power-parity-weighted GDP (the bars in Figure 3.10). highly concentrated and difficult-to-relocate produc- tion, hard-to-substitute consumption, and critical role as inputs for manufacturing and key technologies. Frag- mentation in commodity markets is on the rise. Mea- sures restricting commodity trade surged in 2022, price differentials across geographic markets have widened for selected commodities, and FDI flows in commodity sectors are in decline—the latter a trend that started before the war in Ukraine. Illustrative model simulations suggest that more severe fragmentation could cause large changes in commodity prices, depending on the resulting supply-and-demand imbalances and commodities’ elasticities of supply and demand. Critical minerals for the energy transition and some highly traded agricultural goods are highly vulner- able in the event of fragmentation. A fragmented world would be more volatile. Com- modity price volatility could intensify as a result of smaller market sizes and the incentives for producers to switch geopolitical allegiances. This could result in volatile inflation dynamics, making monetary policy more complex. The potential impacts of fragmentation differ vastly across countries, with offsetting effects across con- sumer and producer countries resulting in modest output losses at the global level. Low-income coun- tries, on average, would experience significantly deeper long-term output declines. Given the heavy reliance on agricultural imports among many low-income countries, fragmentation of agricultural commodities would raise important food security concerns. Illus- trative model simulations suggest that a hypothetical China-Russia+ bloc could be more affected economi- cally than a US-Europe+ bloc, although the economic impact would be reduced if commodity trade was only partially restricted or there was a nonaligned bloc. Overall, further fragmentation of commodity markets could deliver an additional blow in an already challeng- ing environment of slow global growth, tight financial conditions, and high debt, a blow that would be partic- ularly harsh for some of the most vulnerable economies. Fragmentation in critical mineral markets could make the clean energy transition more costly, raising the risks of delaying necessary climate change mitiga- tion. It could add to the upward price pressure in the mineral-scarce bloc in the chapter’s illustrative model simulation. The mineral-rich bloc in the simulation could not reap the benefits from oversupply in the near term because it would be unable to scale up refining and processing capacity quickly. In the simulation, Figure 3.10.

CHAPTER 3 F R a g MENT a TION a ND C OMMODIT y Ma RKET s : vULNER ab ILITIE s a ND R I s K s 85International Monetary Fund | October 2023 fragmentation results in lower-than-needed global investment in renewables and EVs by 2030 by as much as 30 per cent. Given these findings, should advanced economies try to keep commodity trade open? Should emerging market and developing economies be concerned about the potentially higher cost of the green transition? For both questions, the answer is yes. Even if the simulations suggest that commodity fragmentation would not result in very deep aggre- gate output losses in a US-Europe+ bloc, the threat of derailing the global green energy transition should give advanced economies pause. With more than half of worldwide emissions generated by the hypothetical China-Russia+ bloc, averting climate disaster globally hinges on the ability of the economies in that bloc to make a successful and timely clean energy transition. On the other hand, many low- and medium-income countries, whose main objective is raising living stan- dards, may want to think twice, considering the threat of lower output and higher inflation from commodity market fragmentation. All countries would suffer from the greater volatility and uncertainty that fragmented commodity markets would bring. A protracted process of fragmentation, driven by complex and hard-to-predict policy measures and fluid implementation, would also heighten uncer- tainty, depressing private investment and potentially diverting scarce public resources toward a suboptimal reshoring of commodity supply. Preventing fragmentation of commodity markets is the first-best response. Multilateral cooperation can provide guardrails and prevent a vicious spiral of countries imposing restrictions as a risk management effort to mitigate the economic fallout from frag- mentation. First-best multilateral solutions include enhanced rules within the World T rade Organization on quantitative restrictions, export tariffs, discrimina- tory subsidies, local-content requirements, and other commodity-related trade measures (see Bown 2023). This is crucial for food commodities, as food insecurity affects a large swath of the population in low-income countries. 31 31Giordani, Rocha, and Ruta (2016) show that on top of the usual distortionary effects, trade-restricting measures for food can have multiplier effects. High food prices can trigger export restric- tions while importers reduce import tariffs. These policies exacerbate tensions in world food markets and could generate another round of trade restrictions. Second-best solutions can also be considered. Given the potentially adverse effects of fragmentation on the energy transition, a minimum “green corridor” agreement should be established to preserve integrated markets for minerals that are critical for decarbon- ization. Safeguarding the flow of these minerals can be part of a foundational minimum agreement across countries. Without underestimation of the political difficulties, such a corridor agreement could be easier to agree on, because it would focus on a smaller set of commodities and countries. Similar “food corri- dor” agreements could provide guardrails in essential agricultural commodity markets, ensure equal access to food across countries of all income levels, and reduce the likelihood of humanitarian disasters in a world of more frequent supply shocks. While many minerals used in clean energy tech- nologies are bound to become critical for the global economy, the paucity of data on their consumption, production, and inventories raises uncertainty for producers and consumers and could hide potential risks for financial markets. In this respect, the interna- tional community could facilitate the green transition and support energy security by setting up a platform or organization to improve sharing and standardization of international data on mineral production, consump- tion, and inventories. The initiative could be similar to the Joint Organisations Data Initiative for fossil fuels and the Agricultural Market Information System for food commodities. Even as policymakers strive to mitigate the risk of fragmentation, countries can take steps to minimize the potential economic fallout. The geographic con- centration of production and lack of diversification of commodity suppliers call for (1) fostering investment in domestic mining, exploration, and recycling of critical minerals; (2) diversification of supply sources; and (3) investing in infrastructure to reduce trade costs and improve market integration. Support for inno- vation to speed technological progress—and develop substitutes—would enhance efficiency in the use and buildup of strategic reserves. Multilateral coopera- tion would enhance efficiency and prevent negative cross-country spillovers. Broader policies that strengthen countries’ resil- ience to shocks can help mitigate the effects of commodity shocks. These include strengthening mac- roeconomic, structural, and fiscal policy frameworks; building fiscal and financial buffers; and developing preparedness plans in case of sudden disruptions in WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: Nav I g a T IN g gLO b a L D I v E R g E NCE s 86 In ternational Monetary Fund | October 2023 commodity supply. Countries should also reinforce social safety nets to protect vulnerable households from higher commodity prices and volatility. Since fragmentation in physical commodity markets could exacerbate financial market volatility and result in sharp exchange rate adjustments, policy measures that prevent disruptions in commodity-derivatives markets and financial instability may be warranted (April 2023 Global Financial Stability Report). Industrial policies are only the third-best approach and must be designed carefully to ensure equal treat- ment of firms across competitive markets to avert adverse cross-country spillovers, minimize distortions and inefficiencies, and mitigate fiscal risks and harmful political economy outcomes. “Friend-shoring” policies can also be market distorting and costly. Both sets of policies should be used only under particular condi- tions, such as in the presence of clear market failures or narrowly defined national security concerns. Domestic and global costs are more limited—and economies more resilient to shocks—if restriction-free trade applies to larger economic zones. Country-based restrictions on domestic content are suboptimal, because they can interfere with price signals, reduce competition, and therefore lower productivity. Developing a framework for international consultations on friend-shoring prac- tices could help identify negative cross-border spillovers and mitigate adverse consequences. CHAPTER 3 F R a g MENT a TION a ND C OMMODIT y Ma RKET s : vULNER ab ILITIE s a ND R I s K s 87International Monetary Fund | October 2023 Since its invasion of Ukraine, Russia’s oil exports have been subject to sanctions and have been voluntarily shunned by firms. What has been the impact on oil trade flows? Granular real-time data on tanker ship- ping patterns from the Automatic Identification System 1 uncover significant shifts in routes, resulting in economic inefficiencies. The European Union, United Kingdom, and United States banned most imports of crude oil and petro- leum products from Russia after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Western restrictions on dollar payments have been reported to be a barrier to shipments. Group of Seven (G7) members also prohibited transportation The authors of this box are Seung Mo Choi and Alessandra Sozzi. 1The Automatic Identification System is a mandatory self-reporting system for all ships above 300 gross tons. It has been used to construct real-time trade indicators (examples are included in Arslanalp, Marini, and T umbarello 2019; Cer- deiro and others 2020; and Arslanalp, Koepke, and Verschuur 2021). PortWatch (https:// www .imf .org/ por twatch) is an online platform that monitors trade disruptions and assesses spillovers through port-to-port links. and insurance services to tankers carrying Russian commodities above certain price thresholds. Automatic Identification System data reveal that the traffic patterns of Russia’s tankers have since changed substantially (Figure 3.1.1). Tanker shipments from Rus- sian ports to Japan, the United States, and the European Union declined between April–June 2019 and the same period in 2023. Other countries are also now providing oil supplies. For example, the European Union receives more shipments from countries such as Norway, the United Arab Emirates, and the United States, but this extends the length of tanker routes by 20 per cent.2 On the flip side, Russian oil shipments rose after the invasion to countries such as China, India, Türkiye, and the United Arab Emirates. About 35 to 40 per - cent of India’s crude oil imports came from Russia during April–June 2023, a stark rise from less than 5 per cent before the war in Ukraine. While India’s oil exports (mostly petroleum products) are small relative to its oil imports (mostly crude oil), India increased its oil exports to the European Union substantially. 2UNCTAD (2022) documents a rise in tanker freight rates following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. –2.5M 2.5M 3.5M–1.5M 1.5M–750K 750K–100K 100K Figure 3.1.1.

Commodity Trade Tensions: Evidence from Tanker Traffic Data WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: Nav I g a T IN g gLO b a L D I v E R g E NCE s 88 In ternational Monetary Fund | October 2023 History points to a fluid range of experiences of fragmen- tation in commodity markets: from full trade disruption during World War II, to limited and controlled trade during the Cold War, to trade embargoes and other export restrictions. Fragmentation has rarely lasted, given com- modities’ fungibility and arbitrage opportunities. During World War II, trade among the three major blocs—German-controlled Europe, Japanese-controlled Asia, and the rest of the world (the Allies)—stopped (Findlay and O’Rourke 2007). 1 Some blocs faced commodity shortages: for example, shortages of crude oil (produced mostly by the Allies) in Germany and Japan and of natural rubber (pro- duced mostly by Japan) in the Allies (T uttle 1981). In both cases, governments worked with firms to alleviate shortages. Germany developed a coal-based synthetic fuel industry. By 1940, the fuel it produced accounted for nearly half of Germany’s oil supply and 95 per cent of its aviation fuel (Painter 2012). The US government stockpiled natural rubber and worked with industry to develop synthetic rubber (ACS 1998). During the Cold War, trade between the US-led and the Soviet Union–led blocs was limited as a result of the Soviet strategy of self-sufficiency. 2 The Soviet Union traded crude oil, natural gas, and some metals for manufactured and agricultural goods, especially wheat. T raders often skirted government policies to The author of this box is Peter Nagle. 1T rade between blocs and neutral countries was affected by the war. For example, the United Kingdom and United States bought much of the Spanish tungsten output to raise its price and limit availability for Germany. Between 1941 and 1943, the price of tungsten rose 13-fold (Caruana and Rockoff 2001). 2East-West trade was sharply reduced by the Cold War, from three-quarters of trade by the East in 1938 to 14 per cent in 1953. In contrast, within-bloc trade and interdependence rose (Spulber and Gehrels 1958; Foreman-Peck 1995). facilitate this exchange (Farchy and Blas 2021). Politi- cal considerations also dominated trade. For example, after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, US President Jimmy Carter imposed a partial embargo on US grain exports to the Soviet Union. 3 The embargo, however, was ineffective due to the global nature of grain mar- kets. While Soviet imports of US wheat fell sharply, they were replaced by imports from other countries, especially Argentina (Oki 2008). Commodity market embargoes have often been used to apply political pressure. The Arab members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Coun- tries (OPEC) initiated an export embargo against the United States and other countries in 1973 during the Arab-Israeli war and announced a 25 per cent cut in output. Oil prices more than quadrupled between Sep- tember 1973 and January 1974. The oil market was significantly disrupted; however, the disruption was short-lived, as traders diverted oil to embargoed coun- tries and production from non-OPEC countries rose (McNally 2017). Importers also took steps to reduce vulnerability, for example, by mandating efficiency improvements and creating strategic oil inventories (Baffes and Nagle 2022). Another embargo example is that of South Africa during apartheid. Several governments implemented wide-ranging bans on exports to South Africa, partic- ularly crude oil. However, sanctions were blunted by traders who were willing to risk violating sanctions to supply oil at high prices (Farchy and Blas 2021). Overall, the historical examples showcase the ability of fungible commodities to find their way from produc- ers to consumers, absent near-absolute trade barriers. 3In 1980, the Soviet Union planned to import 35 million metric tons of grain—25 million of that from the United States. It ended up importing only 8 million tons, committed to under a previous treaty (JEC 1980). Box 3.2. Commodity Market Fragmentation in History: Many Shades of Gray CHAPTER 3 F R a g MENT a TION a ND C OMMODIT y Ma RKET s : vULNER ab ILITIE s a ND R I s K s 89International Monetary Fund | October 2023 Fragmentation of commodity markets affects countries and households differently. This box demonstrates that low-income countries are more vulnerable in the event of fragmentation, especially of agricultural commodities, owing to their greater reliance on food imports. The find- ing raises important food security concerns should further fragmentation materialize. T o quantify the impact on long-term GDP of fragmentating trade in multiple commodities simul- taneously, a multicountry, multisector trade model is used in this box, following Caliendo and Parro (2015). Bolhuis, Chen, and Kett (2023) augment the model to account for trade and production of 133 commod- ities across 145 countries. Labor is the only factor of production, and productivity is exogenous. Commod- ities are used as intermediate inputs, with a long-term supply elasticity of 1. The model accounts for the input-output structure of global trade and assumes low The authors of this box are Marijn Bolhuis, Jiaqian Chen, and Benjamin Kett. See Bolhuis, Chen, and Kett (2023) for further details. elasticity of substitution between commodities and other inputs in the production of manufactured goods. T rade costs are set such that there is no commodity trade between blocs. Results show that the aggregate impact of commod- ity fragmentation would be moderate, with a global GDP loss of 0.3 per cent (Figure 3.3.1). However, there would be large differences within and across blocs. Some economies might benefit from trade diver- sion as competitors lose access to export markets. Most would experience permanent output declines. Losses would be larger in countries where commodity trade with the other bloc was significant. The China-Russia+ bloc and low-income countries—whose economies are more commodity-intensive—would lose more. Low-income countries’ high dependence on imports of agricultural goods would make them particularly vulnerable (Figure 3.3.2). Disrupting trade in food commodities alone would lead to losses of 1 per cent of GDP . Commodity fragmentation could also have high social and humanitarian costs and would be partic- ularly harmful for lower-income households, which spend a large share of their incomes on food and fuel.

In ternational Monetary Fund | October 2023 93 T he Statistical Appendix presents historical data as well as projections. It comprises eight sections: Assumptions, What’s New, Data and Conventions, Country Notes, Classification of Countries, General Features and Composition of Groups in the World Economic Outlook Classification, Key Data Documentation, and Statistical Tables. The first section summarizes the assump- tions underlying the estimates and projections for 2023–24. The second section briefly describes the changes to the database and statistical tables since the April 2023 World Economic Outlook (WEO). The third section offers a general description of the data and the conventions used for calculating coun- try group composites. The fourth section presents selected key information for each country. The fifth section summarizes the classification of countries in the various groups presented in the WEO, and the sixth section explains that classification in further detail. The seventh section provides information on methods and reporting standards for the member countries’ national account and government finance indicators included in the report. The last, and main, section comprises the sta- tistical tables. Statistical Appendix A is included here; Statistical Appendix B is available online at www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO. Data in these tables have been compiled on the basis of information available through September 25, 2023. The figures for 2023–24 are shown with the same degree of precision as the historical figures solely for convenience; because they are projections, the same degree of accuracy is not to be inferred. Assumptions Real effective exchange rates for the advanced economies are assumed to remain constant at their average levels measured during July 25, 2023– August 22, 2023. For 2023 and 2024 these assump- tions imply average US dollar–special drawing right conversion rates of 1.340 and 1.340, US dollar–eur o conversion rates 1 of 1.088 and 1.094, and yen– US dollar conversion rates of 139.1 and 143.1, respectively. It is assumed that the price of oil will average $80.49 a barrel in 2023 and $79.92 a barrel in 2024. National authorities’ established policies are assumed to be maintained. Box A1 describes the more specific policy assumptions underlying the projections for selected economies. With regard to interest rates, it is assumed that the three-month government bond yield for the United States will average 5.3 percent in 2023 and 5.4 percent in 2024, that for the euro area will average 3.0 percent in 2023 and 3.2 percent in 2024, and that for Japan will average –0.2 percent in 2023 and –0.1 percent in 2024. Further it is assumed that the 10-year govern- ment bond yield for the United States will average 3.8 per cent in 2023 and 4.0 percent in 2024, that for the euro area will average 2.4 percent in 2023 and 2.6 per cent in 2024, and that for Japan will average 0.5 percent in 2023 and 0.6 per cent in 2024. What’ s New • E cuador’s fiscal sector projections, which were previ- ously omitted due to ongoing program discussions, are now included. • E ritrea’s data and projections for 2020–28 are excluded from the database due to constraints in data reporting. • Sri Lanka’s projections for 2023–28 are excluded from publication owing to ongoing discussions on sovereign debt restructuring. • U kraine’s projections for 2024–28, in line with the program’s baseline scenario, are now included. • F or West Bank and Gaza, certain projections for 2022–28 are excluded from publication pending methodological adjustments to statistical series. 1 I n regard to the introduction of the euro, on December 31, 1998, the Council of the European Union decided that, effective January 1, 1999, the irrevocably fixed conversion rates between the euro and currencies of the member countries adopting the euro are as described in Box 5.4 of the October 1998 WEO. See that box as well for details on how the conversion rates were established. For the most recent table of fixed conversion rates, see the Statistical Appendix of the April 2023 WEO. STATISTICAL APPENDIX WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: NAVIGATING GLOBAL DIVERGENCES 94 In ternational Monetary Fund | October 2023 Data and Conventions Data and projections for 196 economies form the statistical basis of the WEO database. The data are maintained jointly by the IMF’s Research Department and regional departments, with the latter regularly updating country projections based on consistent global assumptions. Although national statistical agencies are the ultimate providers of historical data and definitions, international organizations are also involved in statisti- cal issues, with the objective of harmonizing meth- odologies for the compilation of national statistics, including analytical frameworks, concepts, definitions, classifications, and valuation procedures used in the production of economic statistics. The WEO database reflects information from both national source agencies and international organizations. Most countries’ macroeconomic data as presented in the WEO conform broadly to the 2008 version of the System of National Accounts (SNA 2008). The IMF’s sector statistical standards—the sixth edition of the Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual (BPM6), the Monetary and Finan- cial Statistics Manual and Compilation Guide, and the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2014 (GFSM 2014)—have been aligned with the SNA 2008. These standards reflect the IMF’s special interest in countries’ external positions, monetary developments, financial sector stability, and public sector fiscal positions. The process of adapting country data to the new standards begins in earnest when the manuals are released. How- ever, full concordance with the manuals is ultimately dependent on the provision by national statistical compilers of revised country data; hence, the WEO estimates are only partly adapted to these manuals. Nonetheless, for many countries, conversion to the updated standards will have only a small impact on major balances and aggregates. Many other countries have partially adopted the latest standards and will continue implementation over a number of years. 2 The fiscal gross and net debt data reported in the WEO are drawn from official data sources and IMF staff estimates. While attempts are made to align gross and net debt data with the definitions in the GFSM 2 M any countries are implementing the SNA 2008 or European System of National and Regional Accounts 2010, and a few coun- tries use versions of the SNA older than that from 1993. A similar adoption pattern is expected for the BPM6 and GFSM 2014. Please refer to Table G, which lists the statistical standards to which each country adheres. 2014, as a result of data limitations or specific country circumstances, these data can sometimes deviate from the formal definitions. Although every effort is made to ensure the WEO data are relevant and internationally comparable, differences in both sectoral and instru- ment coverage mean that the data are not universally comparable. As more information becomes available, changes in either data sources or instrument coverage can give rise to data revisions that are sometimes sub- stantial. For clarification on the deviations in sectoral or instrument coverage, please refer to the metadata for the online WEO database. Composite data for country groups in the WEO are either sums or weighted averages of data for individual countries. Unless noted otherwise, multiyear averages of growth rates are expressed as compound annual rates of change. 3 Arithmetically weighted averages are used for all data for the emerging market and developing economies group—except data on inflation and money growth, for which geometric averages are used. The following conventions apply: Country group composites for exchange rates, inter- est rates, and growth rates of monetary aggregates are weighted by GDP converted to US dollars at market exchange rates (averaged over the preceding three years) as a share of group GDP . Composites for other data relating to the domestic economy, whether growth rates or ratios, are weighted by GDP valued at purchasing power parity as a share of total world or group GDP . 4 For the aggregation of world and advanced economies (and subgroups) infla- tion, annual rates are simple percentage changes from the previous years; for the aggregation of emerging market and developing economies (and subgroups) inflation, annual rates are based on logarithmic differences. Composites for real GDP per capita in purchasing- power-parity terms are sums of individual country data 3 A verages for real GDP , inflation, GDP per capita, and com- modity prices are calculated based on the compound annual rate of change, except in the case of the unemployment rate, which is based on the simple arithmetic average. 4 S ee Box 1.1 of the October 2020 WEO for a summary of the revised purchasing-power-parity-based weights as well as “Revised Purchasing Power Parity Weights” in the July 2014 WEO Update, Appendix 1.1 of the April 2008 WEO, Box A2 of the April 2004 WEO, Box A1 of the May 2000 WEO, and Annex IV of the May 1993 WEO.

STATISTICAL APPENDIX In ternational Monetary Fund | October 2023 95 after conversion to international dollars in the years indicated. Unless noted otherwise, composites for all sectors for the euro area are corrected for reporting discrepan- cies in transactions within the area. Unadjusted annual GDP data are used for the euro area and for the major- ity of individual countries, except for Cyprus, Ireland, Portugal, and Spain, which report calendar-adjusted data. For data prior to 1999, data aggregations apply 1995 European currency unit exchange rates. Composites for fiscal data are sums of individual country data after conversion to US dollars at the aver- age market exchange rates in the years indicated. Composite unemployment rates and employment growth are weighted by labor force as a share of group labor force. Composites relating to external sector statistics are sums of individual country data after conversion to US dollars at the average market exchange rates in the years indicated for balance of payments data and at end-of-year market exchange rates for debt denomi- nated in currencies other than US dollars. Composites of changes in foreign trade volumes and prices, however, are arithmetic averages of per cent changes for individual countries weighted by the US dollar value of exports or imports as a share of total world or group exports or imports (in the preceding year). Unless noted otherwise, group composites are computed if 90 percent or more of the share of group weights is represented. Data refer to calendar years, except in the case of a few countries that use fiscal years; Table F lists the economies with exceptional reporting periods for national accounts and government finance data. For some countries, the figures for 2022 and earlier are based on estimates rather than actual outturns; Table G lists the latest actual outturns for the indi- cators in the national accounts, prices, government finance, and balance of payments for each country. Country Notes Afghanistan: Data for 2021 and 2022 are estimates and reported for selected indicators only, and projec- tions for 2023–28 are omitted because of an unusu- ally high degree of uncertainty given that the IMF has paused its engagement with the country owing to a lack of clarity within the international com- munity regarding the recognition of a government in Afghanistan. Algeria: T otal government expenditure and net lend- ing/borrowing include net lending by the government, which mostly reflects support to the pension system and other public sector entities. Argentina: The official national consumer price index (CPI) starts in December 2016. For earlier periods, CPI data for Argentina reflect the Greater Buenos Aires Area CPI (prior to December 2013); the national CPI (IPCNu, December 2013 to October 2015); the City of Buenos Aires CPI (November 2015 to April 2016); and the Greater Buenos Aires Area CPI (May 2016 to December 2016). Given limited comparability of these series because of dif- ferences in geographical coverage, weights, sampling, and methodology, the WEO does not report average CPI inflation for 2014–16 and end-of-period infla- tion for 2015–16. Also, Argentina discontinued the publication of labor market data starting in the fourth quarter of 2015, and new series became available starting in the second quarter of 2016. Bangladesh: Data and forecasts are presented on a fiscal year basis. However, country group aggregates that include Bangladesh use calendar year estimates of real GDP and purchasing-power-parity GDP . Costa Rica: The central government definition has been expanded as of January 1, 2021, to include 51 public entities as per Law 9524. Data back to 2019 are adjusted for comparability. Dominican Republic: The fiscal series have the following coverage: public debt, debt service, and the cyclically adjusted/structural balances are for the consolidated public sector (which includes the central government, the rest of the nonfinancial public sector, and the central bank); the remaining fiscal series are for the central government. Eritrea: Data and projections for 2020–28 are excluded from the database due to constraints in data reporting. India: Real GDP growth rates are calculated as per national accounts: for 1998 to 2011 with base year 2004/05 and, thereafter, with base year 2011/12. Iran: Historical figures of nominal GDP in US dol- lars are computed using the official exchange rate up to 2017. From 2018 onward, the NIMA exchange rate, rather than the official exchange rate, is now used to convert nominal rial GDP figures into US dollars. The IMF staff assesses that the NIMA rate better reflects the transaction-value-weighted exchange rate in the economy over that period of time. WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: NAVIGATING GLOBAL DIVERGENCES 96 In ternational Monetary Fund | October 2023 Italy: Data and forecasts reflect information available through September 21, 2023. Lebanon: Data for 2021–22 are IMF staff estimates and not provided by the national authorities. Projec- tions for 2023–28 are omitted owing to an unusually high degree of uncertainty. Libya: Projections do not include the impact of the floods which occurred in September 2023. Sierra Leone: Although the currency was rede- nominated on July 1, 2022, local currency data are expressed in the old leone for the October 2023 WEO. Sri Lanka: Projections for 2023–28 are excluded from publication owing to ongoing discussions on sovereign debt restructuring. Sudan: Projections reflect staff’s analysis based on the assumption that the conflict will end by the end of 2023. Syria: Data are excluded from 2011 onward because of the uncertain political situation. Türkiye: The projections are based on information available as of September 8, 2023, and do not fully incorporate a policy rate increase and additional quanti- tative tightening made after that date. Turkmenistan: Real GDP data are IMF staff esti- mates compiled in line with international methodolo- gies (SNA), using official estimates and sources as well as United Nations and World Bank databases. Esti- mates of and projections for the fiscal balance exclude receipts from domestic bond issuances as well as priva- tization operations, in line with the GFSM 2014. The authorities’ official estimates for fiscal accounts, which are compiled using domestic statistical methodologies, include bond issuance and privatization proceeds as part of government revenues. Ukraine: Revised national accounts data are available beginning in 2000 and exclude Crimea and Sevastopol from 2010 onward. United Kingdom: Projections do not incorporate the significant statistical upward revisions to 2020 and 2021 GDP that were previewed on September 1, 2023 (with a release date of September 29, 2023). Uruguay: In December 2020 the authorities began reporting the national accounts data according to the SNA 2008, with the base year 2016. The new series begin in 2016. Data prior to 2016 reflect the IMF staff’s best effort to preserve previously reported data and avoid structural breaks. Since October 2018 Uruguay’s public pension system has been receiving transfers in the context of law 19,590 that compensates persons affected by the creation of the mixed pension system. These funds are recorded as revenues, consistent with the IMF’s meth- odology. Therefore, data and projections for 2018–22 are affected by these transfers, which amounted to 1.2 percent of GDP in 2018, 1.1 percent of GDP in 2019, 0.6 percent of GDP in 2020, 0.3 percent of GDP in 2021, 0.1 percent of GDP in 2022, and 0 percent thereafter. See IMF Country Report 19/64 for further details. 5 The disclaimer about the public pension system applies only to the revenues and net lending/ borrowing series. The coverage of the fiscal data for Uruguay was changed from consolidated public sector to nonfinancial public sector with the October 2019 WEO. In Uruguay, nonfinancial public sector coverage includes the central government, local government, social security funds, nonfinancial public corporations, and Banco de Seguros del Estado. Historical data were also revised accordingly. Under this narrower fiscal perimeter—which excludes the central bank—assets and liabilities held by the nonfinancial public sector for which the counterpart is the central bank are not netted out in debt figures. In this context, capitalization bonds issued in the past by the government to the central bank are now part of the nonfinancial public sector debt. Gross and net debt estimates for 2008–11 are preliminary. Venezuela: Projecting the economic outlook, includ- ing assessing past and current economic developments used as the basis for the projections, is rendered dif- ficult by the lack of discussions with the authorities (the most recent Article IV consultation took place in 2004), incomplete metadata of limited reported statistics, and difficulties in reconciling reported indica- tors with economic developments. The fiscal accounts include the budgetary central government; social security; FOGADE (insurance deposit institution); and a reduced set of public enterprises, including Petróleos de Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA). Following some meth- odological upgrades to achieve a more robust nominal GDP , historical data and indicators expressed as a per- centage of GDP have been revised from 2012 onward. For most indicators, data for 2018–22 are IMF staff estimates. The effects of hyperinflation and the paucity of reported data mean that the IMF staff’s projected macroeconomic indicators should be interpreted with caution. Broad uncertainty surrounds these projec- tions. Venezuela’s consumer prices are excluded from all WEO group composites. 5 U ruguay: Staff Report for the 2018 Article IV Consultation, Coun- try Report 19/64 (Washington, DC: International Monetary Fund, February 2019). STATISTICAL APPENDIX In ternational Monetary Fund | October 2023 97 West Bank and Gaza: Certain projections for 2022–28 are excluded from publication pending methodological adjustments to statistical series. Zimbabwe: Authorities have recently finished rede- nominating their national accounts statistics following the introduction in 2019 of the Real Time Gross Settlement dollar, later renamed the Zimbabwe dollar. The Zimba- bwe dollar previously ceased circulating in 2009, and dur- ing 2009–19 Zimbabwe operated under a multicurrency regime with the US dollar as the unit of account. Classification of Countries Summary of the Country Classification The country classification in the WEO divides the world into two major groups: advanced economies and emerging market and developing economies. 6 This classification is not based on strict criteria, economic or otherwise, and has evolved over time. The objective is to facilitate analysis by providing a reasonably mean- ingful method of organizing data. Table A provides an overview of the country classification, showing the number of countries in each group by region and summarizing some key indicators of their relative size (GDP valued at purchasing power parity, total exports of goods and services, and population). Some countries remain outside the country classifi- cation and therefore are not included in the analysis. Cuba and the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea are examples of countries that are not IMF mem- bers, and the IMF therefore does not monitor their economies. General Features and Composition of Groups in the World Economic Outlook Classification Advanced Economies Table B lists the 41 advanced economies. The seven largest in terms of GDP based on market exchange rates—the United States, Japan, Germany, France, Italy, the United Kingdom, and Canada—constitute the subgroup of major advanced economies, often referred to as the Group of Seven. The members of the euro area are also distinguished as a subgroup. Com- posite data shown in the tables for the euro area cover 6 As used here, the terms “country” and “economy” do not always refer to a territorial entity that is a state as understood by interna- tional law and practice. Some territorial entities included here are not states, although their statistical data are maintained on a separate and independent basis. the current members for all years, even though the membership has increased over time. Table C lists the member countries of the European Union, not all of which are classified as advanced economies in the WEO. Emerging Market and Developing Economies The group of emerging market and developing economies (155) comprises all those that are not classi- fied as advanced economies. The regional breakdowns of emerging market and developing economies are emerging and developing Asia; emerging and developing Europe (sometimes also referred to as “central and eastern Europe”); Latin America and the Caribbean; Middle East and Central Asia (which comprises the regional subgroups Caucasus and Central Asia; and Middle East, North Africa, Afghanistan, and Pakistan); and sub-Saharan Africa. Emerging market and developing economies are also classified according to analytical criteria that reflect the composition of export earnings and a distinction between net creditor and net debtor economies. Tables D and E show the detailed composition of emerging market and developing economies in the regional and analytical groups. The analytical criterion source of export earnings distinguishes between the categories fuel (Standard International T rade Classification [SITC] 3) and nonfuel and then focuses on nonfuel primary products (SITCs 0, 1, 2, 4, and 68). Economies are categorized into one of these groups if their main source of export earnings exceeded 50 percent of total exports on aver- age between 2018 and 2022. The financial and income criteria focus on net credi- tor economies, net debtor economies, heavily indebted poor countries (HIPCs), low-income developing countries (LIDCs), and emerging market and middle-income economies (EMMIEs). Economies are categorized as net debtors when their latest net international investment position, where available, was less than zero or their current account balance accumulations from 1972 (or earliest available data) to 2022 were negative. Net debtor economies are further differentiated on the basis of experience with debt servicing. 7 7 D uring 2018–22, 39 economies incurred external payments arrears or entered into official or commercial bank debt-rescheduling agreements. This group is referred to as economies with arrears and/or rescheduling during 2018–22. WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: NAVIGATING GLOBAL DIVERGENCES 98 In ternational Monetary Fund | October 2023 The HIPC group comprises the countries that are or have been considered by the IMF and the World Bank for participation in their debt initia- tive known as the HIPC Initiative, which aims to reduce the external debt burdens of all the eligible HIPCs to a “sustainable” level in a reasonably short period of time. 8 Many of these countries have already 8 S ee David Andrews, Anthony R. Boote, Syed S. Rizavi, and Sukwinder Singh, “Debt Relief for Low-Income Countries: The Enhanced HIPC Initiative,” IMF Pamphlet Series 51 (Washington, DC: International Monetary Fund, November 1999). benefited from debt relief and have graduated from the initiative. The LIDCs are countries that have per capita income levels below a certain threshold (set at $2,700 in 2016 as measured by the World Bank’s Atlas method), structural features consistent with limited development and structural transformation, and external financial linkages insufficiently close for them to be widely seen as emerging market economies. The EMMIEs group comprises emerging market and developing economies that are not classified as LIDCs. STATISTICAL APPENDIX In ternational Monetary Fund | October 2023 99 Table A.

STATISTICAL APPENDIX In ternational Monetary Fund | October 2023 115 Fiscal Policy Assumptions The short-term fiscal policy assumptions used in the World Economic Outlook (WEO) are normally based on officially announced budgets, adjusted for differences between the national authori- ties and the IMF staff regarding macroeconomic assumptions and projected fiscal outturns. When no official budget has been announced, projections incorporate policy measures judged likely to be implemented. The medium-term fiscal projections are similarly based on a judgment about policies’ most likely path. For cases in which the IMF staff has insufficient information to assess the authori- ties’ budget intentions and prospects for policy implementation, an unchanged structural primary balance is assumed unless indicated otherwise. Specific assumptions used in regard to some of the advanced economies follow. (See also Tables B5 to B9 in the online section of the Statistical Appen- dix for data on fiscal net lending/borrowing and structural balances.) 1 Argentina: Fiscal projections are based on the available information regarding budget outturn, budget plans, and IMF-supported program targets for the federal government; on fiscal measures announced by the authorities; and on IMF staff macroeconomic projections. Australia: Fiscal projections are based on data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the fis- cal year (FY)2023/24 budgets published by the Commonwealth government and the respective 1 The output gap is actual minus potential output, as a percentage of potential output. Structural balances are expressed as a percentage of potential output. The structural balance is the actual net lending/borrowing minus the effects of cyclical output from potential output, corrected for one-time and other factors, such as asset and commodity prices and output composition effects. Changes in the structural balance consequently include effects of temporary fiscal measures, the impact of fluctuations in interest rates and debt-service costs, and other noncyclical fluc- tuations in net lending/borrowing. The computations of struc- tural balances are based on the IMF staff’s estimates of potential GDP and revenue and expenditure elasticities. (See Annex I of the October 1993 WEO.) Estimates of the output gap and of the structural balance are subject to significant margins of uncer- tainty. Net debt is calculated as gross debt minus financial assets corresponding to debt instruments. state/territory governments, and the IMF staff’s estimates and projections. Austria: Fiscal projections are based on the 2023 budget and the April 2023 Austria Stability Programme. The NextGenerationEU fund and the latest announcement on fiscal measures have also been incorporated. Belgium: Projections are based on the Belgian Stability Programme 2023–26, the 2023 Budget- ary Plan, and other available information on the authorities’ fiscal plans, with adjustments for the IMF staff’s assumptions. Brazil: Fiscal projections for 2023 reflect current policies in place. Canada: Projections use the baseline forecasts from the Government of Canada’s 2023 budget and the latest provincial budgets. The IMF staff makes some adjustments to these forecasts, including those for differences in macroeconomic projections. The IMF staff’s forecast also incorporates the most recent data releases from Statistics Canada’s National Economic Accounts, including quarterly federal, provincial, and territorial budgetary outturns. Chile: Projections are based on the authorities’ budget projections, adjusted to reflect the IMF staff’s projections for GDP , copper prices, deprecia- tion, and inflation. China: Staff fiscal projections incorporate the 2023 budget as well as estimates of off-budget financing. Denmark: Estimates for the current year are aligned with the latest official budget numbers, adjusted where appropriate for the IMF staff’s macroeconomic assumptions. Beyond the current year, the projections incorporate key features of the medium-term fiscal plan as embodied in the authorities’ latest budget. Structural balances are net of temporary fluctuations in some revenues (for example, North Sea revenue, pension yield tax revenue) and one-offs (COVID-19– related one-offs are, however, included). France: Projections for 2023 onward are based on the 2018–23 budget laws, Stability Programme 2023–27, draft medium-term programming bill, and other available information on the authori- ties’ fiscal plans, adjusted for differences in revenue Box A1. Economic Policy Assumptions underlying the Projections for Selected Economies WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: NAVIGATING GLOBAL DIVERGENCES 116 In ternational Monetary Fund | October 2023 projections and assumptions on macroeconomic and financial variables. Germany: The IMF staff’s projections for 2023 and beyond are based on the 2023 budget, the 2023 Stability Programme, the draft 2024 federal budget, the federal government’s medium-term budget plan, and data updates from the national statistical agency (Destatis) and the ministry of finance, adjusted for differences in the IMF staff’s macroeconomic framework and assumptions con- cerning revenue elasticities. Greece: Data since 2010 reflect adjustments in line with the primary balance definition under the enhanced surveillance framework for Greece. Hong Kong Special Administrative Region: Projec- tions are based on the authorities’ medium-term fiscal projections for expenditures. Hungary: Fiscal projections include the IMF staff’s projections for the macroeconomic framework and fiscal policy plans announced in the 2023 budget. India: Projections are based on available informa- tion on the authorities’ fiscal plans, with adjust- ments for the IMF staff’s assumptions. Subnational data are incorporated with a lag of up to one year; general government data are thus finalized well after central government data. IMF and Indian presenta- tions differ, particularly regarding disinvestment and license-auction proceeds, net versus gross recording of revenues in certain minor categories, and some public sector lending. Starting with FY2020/21 data, expenditure also includes the off-budget component of food subsidies, consistent with the revised treatment of food subsidies in the budget. The IMF staff adjusts expenditure to take out pay- ments for previous years’ food subsidies, which are included as expenditure in budget estimates for FY2020/21. Indonesia: The IMF staff’s projections are based on maintaining a neutral fiscal stance going forward, accompanied by moderate tax policy and admin- istration reforms, some expenditure realization, and a gradual increase in capital spending over the medium term in line with fiscal space. Ireland: Fiscal projections are based on the coun- try’s Budget 2023. Italy: The IMF staff’s estimates and projections are informed by the fiscal plans included in the government’s 2023 budget and amendments. The stock of maturing postal bonds is included in the debt projections. Japan: The projections reflect fiscal measures the government has already announced, with adjust- ments for the IMF staff’s assumptions. Korea: The forecast incorporates the overall fis- cal balance in the 2022 annual budget and two supplementary budgets, the proposed 2023 budget and medium-term fiscal plan, and the IMF staff’s adjustments. Mexico: The 2020 public sector borrowing requirements estimated by the IMF staff adjust for some statistical discrepancies between above-the-line and below-the-line numbers. Fiscal projections for 2023 and 2024 are informed by the estimates in Criterios 2024; projections for 2025 onward assume continued compliance with rules established in the Federal Budget and Fiscal Responsibility Law. The Netherlands: Fiscal projections for 2023–28 are based on the IMF staff’s forecast framework and are also informed by the authorities’ draft budget plan and Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis projections. New Zealand: Fiscal projections are based on the FY2023/24 budget (May 2023) and the IMF staff’s estimates. Portugal: The projections for the current year are based on the authorities’ approved budget, adjusted to reflect the IMF staff’s macroeconomic forecast. Projections thereafter are based on the assumption of unchanged policies. Projections for 2023 reflect information available in the 2023 budget proposal. Puerto Rico: Fiscal projections are informed by the Certified Fiscal Plan for the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, which was prepared in April 2023, certified by the Financial Oversight and Manage- ment Board. Russia: The fiscal rule was suspended last year by the government in response to the sanctions imposed after the invasion of Ukraine, allowing for windfall oil and gas revenues above benchmark to be used to finance a larger deficit in 2022. Savings Box A1 (continued) STATISTICAL APPENDIX In ternational Monetary Fund | October 2023 117 accumulated in the National Welfare Fund can also now be used this way. A new fiscal rule will become fully effective in 2025. The new rule allows for higher oil and gas revenues to be spent, but it simultaneously targets a smaller primary structural deficit. Saudi Arabia: The IMF staff’s baseline fiscal projections are based primarily on its understand- ing of government policies as outlined in the 2022 budget. Export oil revenues are based on WEO baseline oil price assumptions and the IMF staff’s understanding of current oil policy under the OPEC+ (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, including Russia and other non-OPEC oil exporters) agreement. Singapore: FY2020 figures are based on budget execution. FY2021 projections are based on revised figures based on budget execution through the end of 2021. FY2022 projections are based on the initial budget of February 18, 2022. The IMF staff assumes gradual withdrawal of remaining pandemic- related measures and the implementation of various revenue measures announced in the FY2022 budget for the remainder of the projection period. These include (1) an increase in the Goods and Services Tax from 7 percent to 8 percent on January 1, 2023, and to 9 percent on January 1, 2024; (2) an increase in property taxes in 2023 for non-owner- occupied properties (from 10 percent–20 percent to 12 percent–36 percent) and for owner-occupied properties with an annual value in excess of $30,000 (from 4 percent–16 percent to 6 percent–32 per- cent); and (3) an increase of the carbon tax from S$5 a tonne to S$25 a tonne in 2024 and 2025 and S$45 a tonne in 2026 and 2027. South Africa: Fiscal assumptions are informed by the 2023 budget. Nontax revenue excludes transac- tions in financial assets and liabilities, as they involve primarily revenues associated with realized exchange rate valuation gains from the holding of foreign currency deposits, sale of assets, and conceptually similar items. Spain: Fiscal projections from 2023 onward assume energy support measures amounting to 1 percent of GDP in 2023. Projections for 2021–26 reflect disbursements under the EU Recovery and Resilience Facility. Sweden: Fiscal estimates are based on the authorities’ budget projections, adjusted to reflect the IMF staff’s macroeconomic forecasts. Switzerland: The projections assume that fiscal policy is adjusted as necessary to keep fiscal bal- ances in line with the requirements of Switzerland’s fiscal rules. Türkiye: The basis for the projections is the IMF-defined fiscal balance, which excludes some revenue and expenditure items that are included in the authorities’ headline balance. United Kingdom: Fiscal projections are based on the March 2023 forecast from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) and the September 2023 release on public sector finances from the Office for National Statistics. The IMF staff’s projections take the OBR forecast as a reference and overlay adjustments (for dif- ferences in assumptions) to both revenues and expen- ditures. The IMF staff’s forecasts do not necessarily assume that the fiscal rules announced on November 17, 2022, will be met at the end of the forecast period. Data are presented on a calendar year basis. United States: Fiscal projections are based on the May 2023 Congressional Budget Office baseline and the latest T reasury monthly statement, adjusted for the IMF staff’s policy and macroeconomic assumptions. Projections incorporate the effects of the Fiscal Responsibility Act. Monetary Policy Assumptions Monetary policy assumptions are based on the established policy framework in each country. In most cases, this implies a nonaccommodative stance over the business cycle: official interest rates will increase when economic indicators suggest that inflation will rise above its acceptable rate or range; they will decrease when indicators suggest inflation will not exceed the acceptable rate or range, that output growth is below its potential rate, and that the margin of slack in the economy is significant. With regard to interest rates, please refer to the Assumptions section at the beginning of the Statistical Appendix. Box A1 (continued) WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: NAVIGATING GLOBAL DIVERGENCES 118 In ternational Monetary Fund | October 2023 Argentina: Monetary projections are consistent with the overall macroeconomic framework, the fiscal and financing plans, and the monetary and foreign exchange policies under the crawling-peg regime. Australia: Monetary policy assumptions are based on the IMF staff’s analysis and the expected infla- tion path. Brazil: Monetary policy assumptions are consis- tent with the convergence of inflation within the relevant monetary policy horizon. Canada: Projections reflect the gradual unwinding monetary policy tightening by the Bank of Canada, as inflation slowly goes back to its mid-range target of 2 percent by early 2025. Chile: Monetary policy assumptions are consis- tent with attaining the inflation target. China: The overall monetary policy stance was moderately accommodative in 2022 and is expected to remain broadly accommodative in 2023. Denmark: Monetary policy is to maintain the peg to the euro. Euro area: Monetary policy assumptions for euro area member countries are drawn from a suite of models (semi-structural, DSGE [dynamic stochastic general equilibrium], Taylor rule), market expecta- tions, and the European Central Bank Governing Council communication. Hong Kong Special Administrative Region: The IMF staff assumes that the currency board system will remain intact. Hungary: The IMF staff’s estimates and projec- tions are informed by expert judgment based on recent developments. India: Monetary policy projections are consistent with achieving the Reserve Bank of India’s inflation target over the medium term. Indonesia: Monetary policy assumptions are in line with inflation within the central bank’s target band over the medium term. Israel: Monetary policy assumptions are based on gradual normalization of monetary policy. Japan: Monetary policy assumptions are in line with market expectations. Korea: Projections assume that the policy rate will evolve in line with market expectations. Mexico: Monetary policy assumptions are consis- tent with attaining the inflation target. New Zealand: Monetary projections are based on the IMF staff’s analysis and expected inflation path. Russia: Monetary policy projections assume that the Central Bank of the Russian Federation is adopting a tight monetary policy stance. Saudi Arabia: Monetary policy projections are based on the continuation of the exchange rate peg to the US dollar. Singapore: Broad money is projected to grow in line with the projected growth in nominal GDP . South Africa: Monetary policy assumptions are consistent with maintaining inflation within the 3–6 percent target band over the medium term. Sweden: Monetary projections are in line with Riksbank projections. Türkiye: The baseline assumes that the mon- etary policy stance will remain in line with market expectations. United Kingdom: The short-term interest rate path is based on market interest rate expectations. United States: The IMF staff expects the Federal Open Market Committee to continue to adjust the federal funds target rate in line with the broader macroeconomic outlook.

Country group composites are calculated as the sum of the US dollar values for the relevant individual countries. This differs from the calculations in the April 2005 and earlier issues of the World Economic Outlook, in which the composites were weighted by GDP valued at purchasing power parities as a share of total world GDP . The estimates of gross national savings and investment (or gross capital formation) are from individual countries’ national accounts statistics. The estimates of the current account balance, the capital account balance, and the financial account balance (or net lending/net borrowing) are from the balance of payments statistics. The link between domestic transactions and transactions with the rest of the world can be expressed as accounting identities. Savings (S) minus investment (I) is equal to the current account balance (CAB) (S − I = CAB). Also, net lending/net borrowing (NLB) is the sum of the current account balance and the capital account balance (KAB) (NLB = CAB + KAB). In practice, these identities do not hold exactly; imbalances result from imperfections in source data and compilation as well as from asymmetries in group composition due to data availability. 1See the country-specific notes for Italy and the United Kingdom in the “Country Notes” section of the Statistical Appendix. 2Excludes the Group of Seven (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, United Kingdom, United States) and euro area countries.

They welcomed the continued global economic resilience, particularly of some advanced and emerging market economies, but acknowledged that divergent growth prospects across the world’s regions pose a challenge to returning to pre-pandemic output trends. In the case of many emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs), the loss of momentum has reduced prospects for income convergence. Directors recognized that tight monetary policies, necessary to fight inflation, and the withdrawal of fiscal policy support to tackle soaring global debt and support disinflation efforts are also headwinds to growth in the short run. Most Directors agreed that increasing geoeconomic fragmentation is also weighing on the recovery and welcomed the Fund’s analysis on the costs of fragmentation. A few Directors emphasized that diversification in supply chains is important to build resilience. More generally, a number of Directors stressed that the Fund’s communication on geoeconomic fragmentation should be balanced. Directors generally agreed that ending Russia’s war against Ukraine remains the single most impactful action to improve the global outlook. Directors broadly agreed that risks to the outlook are more balanced relative to April 2023, but remain tilted to the downside. While the acute stress in the banking system seen in March this year has subsided, in part due to swift action in Switzerland and the United States, they broadly noted that financial stability risks remain elevated. In particular, Directors emphasized that persistence in global underlying inflation could warrant higher-for-longer policy rates, which could in turn trigger a correction in financial markets and capital flow volatility. They also considered that commodity prices could see more volatility due to climate and geopolitical shocks. Most Directors noted the risk of a further deterioration in China’s property sector and, in this regard, welcomed the recent policy actions taken by the authorities. Directors also highlighted the risk of further debt distress in those EMDEs heavily reliant on external borrowing and generally indicated that the presence of a weak tail of banks in some major economies also poses vulnerabilities. Directors emphasized that should financial conditions tighten abruptly, adverse feedback loops could be triggered and again test the resilience of the global financial system. Directors noted that global core inflation remains persistent and declining only slowly, and stressed that monetary policy should maintain a restrictive policy stance, tailored to country circumstances, until inflation declines sustainably to target. They called for clear and transparent communication to avoid a de-anchoring of inflation expectations. Directors also indicated that policies aimed at encouraging labor market participation can help ease labor market tightness in many advanced economies, which would support disinflation. Directors acknowledged that the fast pace of monetary policy tightening adds further pressure on the financial sector, requiring careful monitoring of risks, better risk assessment and strengthened supervision, and closing supervision gaps in the nonbank financial sector. They called for an assessment of how consistently international standards in banking regulation were implemented during recent financial stresses. Noting vulnerabilities in the commercial real estate sector of some countries, Directors called for continued vigilance and close monitoring. Directors stressed the need to gradually tighten fiscal policies as deficits and debt remain elevated. They considered that, although the primary responsibility for restoring price stability lies with central banks, The following remarks were made by the Chair at the conclusion of the Executive Board’s discussion of the Fiscal Monitor, Global Financial Stability Report, and World Economic Outlook on September 26, 2023. 162 International Monetary Fund | October 2023 WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: Nav I g a T IN g gLO b a L D I v E R g E NCE s tightening the fiscal stance can further ease inflation by reducing aggregate demand and reinforcing the overall credibility of disinflation strategies. Directors recommended mobilizing revenues through tax capacity building and achieving efficiency gains in spending to help restore some fiscal space, while safeguarding targeted measures to protect the most vulnerable. They also noted that some countries in debt distress may require preemptive and orderly debt restructuring, underscoring the importance of multilateral cooperation in this regard. Directors expressed concern over the dimming growth prospects for the medium term. In this context, they emphasized the importance of facilitating investment and of targeted and carefully sequenced supply-side reforms, which can enhance productivity growth despite constrained policy space and help dampen inflationary pressures. Directors called for accelerating decarbonization efforts, while noting that the policy mix will need to strike a balance between climate goals, fiscal sustainability, and political feasibility. They agreed that relying mostly on spending-based measures will be costly and instead favored a combination of revenue, expenditure, and other financing and structural policies to deliver on climate goals. In this context, most Directors agreed that a policy package containing carbon pricing, complemented with measures to address market failures, catalyze private finance and green investment, and mitigate distributional concerns has higher chances to deliver on climate goals and maintain debt sustainability. Some Directors reiterated, however, that carbon pricing is not an adequate solution in all countries. Directors acknowledged that the green transition will be challenging, particularly for EMDEs with high debt and sizable investment needs; at the same time, delaying the transition will only increase its costs. They generally agreed that incorporating climate change considerations into debt sustainability analyses could improve policy planning, while taking into consideration country-specific characteristics. Directors underscored that internationally coordinated efforts are indispensable to minimize the cost of decarbonization, especially for low-income countries and small developing states. In this context, they highlighted the important catalytic role that the Resilience and Sustainability T rust could play in attracting green financing and investments. Directors stressed that green industrial policies should avoid distortions to trade and investment flows, in line with the rules of the World T rade Organization (WTO). In this context, a few Directors emphasized that measures such as carbon border adjustment mechanisms should also be WTO-compliant to safeguard international trade. While they considered that, in principle, green and food corridor agreements could help safeguard the energy transition and avert food insecurity, a few Directors underscored the difficulty of implementing these mechanisms. More generally, Directors emphasized that safeguarding the rules-based trading system would be important for global prosperity.

Almost all nations felt the effects last year of global economic uncertainty, including higher energy and food prices, inflation rates and volatile markets. While all these events and associated instability have serious ramifications on our company, colleagues, clients and countries where we do business, their consequences on the world at large — with the extreme suffering of the Ukrainian people, escalating tragedy in the Middle East and the potential restructuring of the global order — are far more important. As these events unfold, America’s global leadership role is being challenged outside by other nations and inside by our polarized electorate. We need to find ways to put aside our differences and work in partnership with other Western nations in the name of democracy. During this time of great crises, uniting to protect our essential freedoms, including free enterprise, is paramount. We should remember that America, “conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are Jamie Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Office r 2 created equal,” still remains a shining beacon of hope to citizens around the world. JPMorgan Chase, a company that historically has worked across borders and boundaries, will do its part to ensure that the global economy is safe and secure. In spite of the unsettling landscape, including last year’s regional bank turmoil, the U.S. economy continues to be resilient, with consumers still spending, and the markets currently expect a soft landing. It is important to note that the economy is being fueled by large amounts of government deficit spending and past stimulus. There is also a growing need for increased spending as we continue transitioning to a greener economy, restructuring global supply chains, boosting military expenditure and battling rising healthcare costs. This may lead to stickier inflation and higher rates than markets expect. Furthermore, there are downside risks to watch. Quantitative tightening is draining more than $900 billion in liquidity from the system annually — and we have never truly experienced the full effect of quantitative tightening on this scale. Plus the ongoing wars in Ukraine and the Middle East continue to have the potential to disrupt energy and food markets, migration, and military and economic relationships, in addition to their dreadful human cost. These significant and somewhat unprecedented forces cause us to remain cautious. 2023 was another strong year for JPMorgan Chase, with our firm generating record revenue for the sixth consecutive year, as well as setting numerous records in each of our lines of business. We earned revenue in 2023 of $162.4 billion 1 and net income of $49.6 billion, with return on tangible common equity (ROTCE) of 21%, reflecting strong underlying performance across our businesses. We also increased our quarterly common dividend of $1.00 per share to $1.05 per share in the third quarter of 2023 — and again to $1.15 per share in the first quarter of 2024 — while continuing to reinforce our fortress balance sheet. We grew market share in several of our businesses and continued to make significant investments in products, people and technology while exercising strict risk disciplines. Throughout the year, we demonstrated the power of our investment philosophy and guiding principles, as well as the value of being there for clients — as we always are — in both good times and bad times. The result was continued growth broadly across the firm. We will highlight a few examples from 2023: Consumer & Community Banking (CCB) extended its #1 leadership positions and grew share year-over-year in retail deposits, credit card sales and credit card outstandings (adding close to 3.6 million net new customers to the franchise); the Corporate & Investment Bank (CIB) 1 Represents managed revenue. 3 maintained its #1 rank in both Investment Banking and Markets and gained more than 100 basis points of Investment Banking market share; Commercial Banking (CB) added over 5,000 new relationships (excluding First Republic Bank), roughly doubling the prior year’s achievement; and Asset & Wealth Management (AWM) saw record client asset net inflows of $490 billion, over 20% higher than its prior record. In 2023, we continued to play a forceful and essential role in advancing economic growth. In total, we extended credit and raised capital totaling $2.3 trillion for our consumer and institutional clients around the world. On a daily basis, we move nearly $10 trillion in over 120 currencies and more than 160 countries, as well as safeguard over $32 trillion in assets. By purchasing First Republic Bank, we brought much- needed stability to the U.S. banking system while allowing us to give a new, secure home to over half a million First Republic customers. As always, we hold fast to our commitment to corporate responsibility, including helping to create a stronger, more inclusive economy — from supporting work skills training programs around the world to financing affordable housing and small businesses to making investments in cities like Detroit that show how business and government leaders can work together to solve problems. We have achieved our decades-long consistency by adhering to our key principles and strategies (see sidebar on Steadfast Principles on page 5), which allow us to drive good organic growth and promote proper management of our capital (including dividends and stock buybacks). The charts on pages 9–15 show our performance results and illustrate how we have grown our franchises, how we compare with our competitors and how we look at our fortress balance sheet. Please peruse them and the CEO letters in this Annual Report, all of which provide specific details about our businesses and our plans for the future. I remain proud of our company’s resiliency and of what our hundreds of thousands of employees around the world have achieved, collectively and individually. Throughout these challenging past few years, we have never stopped doing all the things we should be doing to serve our clients and our communities. As you know, we are champions of banking’s essential role in a community — its potential for bringing people together, for enabling companies and individuals to attain their goals, and for being a source of strength in difficult times. I often remind our employees that the work we do matters 4 STEADFAST PRINCIPLES WORTH REPEATING (AND ONE NEW ONE) Looking back on the past two+ decades — starting from my time as Chairman and CEO of Bank One in 2000 — there is one common theme: our unwavering dedica - tion to help clients, communities and countries throughout the world. It is clear that our financial discipline, constant investment in innovation and ongoing development of our people have enabled us to achieve this consistency and com- mitment. In addition, across the firm, we uphold certain steadfast tenets that are worth repeating. First, our work has very real human impact. While JPMorgan Chase stock is owned by large institutions, pension plans, mutual funds and directly by single investors, in almost all cases the ultimate beneficiaries are individuals in our com- munities. More than 100 million people in the United States own stocks; many, in one way or another, own JPMorgan Chase stock. Frequently, these shareholders are veterans, teachers, police officers, fire - fighters, healthcare workers, retirees, or those saving for a home, education or retirement. Often, our employees also bank these shareholders, as well as their families and their companies. Your man- agement team goes to work every day recognizing the enormous responsibility that we have to all of our shareholders. Second, shareholder value can be built only if you maintain a healthy and vibrant company, which means doing a good job of taking care of your customers, employ - ees and communities. Conversely, how can you have a healthy company if you neglect any of these stakeholders? As we have learned over the past few years, there are myriad ways an institution can demonstrate its compassion for its employees and its communities while still strengthening shareholder value. Third, while we don’t run the company worrying about the stock price in the short run, in the long run we consider our stock price a measure of our progress over time. This progress is a function of continual investments in our people, systems and products, in good and bad times, to build our capabilities. These important invest- ments will also drive our company’s future prospects and position it to grow and prosper for decades. Measured by stock performance, our progress is exceptional. For example, whether looking back 10 years or even farther to 2004, when the JPMorgan Chase/Bank One merger took place, we have outperformed the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and the Standard & Poor’s Financials Index. Fourth, we are united behind basic princi - ples and strategies (you can see the prin - ciples for How We Do Business on our website and our Purpose statement in my letter from last year) that have helped build this company and made it thrive. These allow us to maintain a fortress bal - ance sheet, constantly invest and nurture talent, fully satisfy regulators, continually improve risk, governance and controls, and serve customers and clients while lifting up communities worldwide. This philosophy is embedded in our company culture and influences nearly every role in the firm. Fifth, we strive to build enduring busi- nesses, which rely on and benefit from one another, but we are not a conglomerate. This structure helps generate our superior returns. Nonetheless, despite our best efforts, the walls that protect this com- pany are not particularly high — and we face extraordinary competition. I have written about this reality extensively in the past and cover it again in this letter. We recognize our strengths and vulnerabili- ties, and we play our hand as best we can. Sixth, and this is the new one, we must be a source of strength, particularly in tough times, for our clients and the countries in which we operate. We must take seriously our role as one of the guardians of the world’s financial systems. Seventh, we operate with a very important silent partner — the U.S. government — noting as my friend Warren Buffett points out that his company’s success is predi- cated upon the extraordinary conditions our country creates. He is right to say to his shareholders that when they see the American flag, they all should say thank you. We should, too. JPMorgan Chase is a healthy and thriving company, and we always want to give back and pay our fair share. We do pay our fair share — and we want it to be spent well and have the greatest impact. To give you an idea of where our taxes and fees go: In the last 10 years, we paid more than $46 billion in federal, state and local taxes in the United States and over $22 billion in taxes outside of the United States. Additionally, we paid the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation over $10 billion so that it has the resources to cover failure in the American banking sector. Our partner — the federal govern- ment — also imposes significant regula- tions upon us, and it is imperative that we meet all legal and regulatory require- ments imposed on our company. Eighth and finally, we know the founda- tion of our success rests with our people. They are the front line, both individually and as teams, serving our customers and communities, building the technology, making the strategic decisions, managing the risks, determining our investments and driving innovation. However you view the world — its complexity, risks and opportunities — a company’s prosperity requires a great team of people with guts, brains, integrity, enormous capabili- ties and high standards of professional excellence to ensure its ongoing success . 5 2000 Jamie Dimon joins Bank One as Chairman and CEO Chase Manhattan buys J.P.

Morgan Chase & Co. 2006 JPMorgan Chase holds ﬁrst Investor Day Asset & Wealth Management assets under management exceed $1 trillion 2008 JPMorgan Chase acquires Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual The collapse of the housing and mortgage markets led to a severe worldwide ﬁnancial crisis, the worst since the Great Depression. JPMorgan Chase helped stabilize the markets by acquiring two failing institutions, Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual (WaMu). WaMu is still the largest failure of an insured depository institution in the history of the FDIC. Importantly, the WaMu deal expanded the bank’s network by more than 2,200 branches, including gaining a footprint in California and Florida.

United by our principles and purpose, we help people and institutions finance and achieve their aspirations, lifting up individuals, homeowners, small businesses, larger corporations, schools, hospitals, cities and countries in all regions of the world. What we have accomplished in the 20 years since the Bank One and JPMorgan Chase merger is evidence of the importance of our values. CELEBRATING THE 20 TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE BANK ONE/JPMORGAN CHASE MERGER J.P. Morgan Chase By 2004, J.P. Morgan Chase already represented the consolidation of four of the 10 largest U.S. banks from 1990: The Chase Manhattan Corp., Manufacturers Hanover, Chemical Banking Corp. and, most recently, J.P. Morgan & Company. And some of their predecessor companies stretched back into the 1800s, one even into the late 1700s. Bank One Bank One had been even busier on the acquisition front, especially across the United States. By 1998, then Banc One had more than 1,300 branches in 12 states when it announced a merger with First Chicago NBD, a Chicago-based bank created just three years earlier by the merger of First Chicago and Detroit-based NBD. Now headquartered in Chicago, the new Bank One became the largest bank in the Midwest, second largest among credit card companies and fourth largest in the United States. But the merger didn’t go as planned, with Bank One issuing three different earnings warnings. In March 2000, Bank One reached outside its executive ranks, and my tenure began as Chairman and CEO, working to overhaul the company and help bring it back to profitability and growth. The story begins ... A merger 20 years ago helped transform two giant banks Fast forward to 2003, and another wave of consolidation was well underway in U.S. banking. Most of the nation’s larger banks were trying to position themselves to be an “endgame winner.” In the biggest deal, Bank of America agreed to buy FleetBoston Financial Corp. for more than $40 billion. Those two banks — already amalgamations of several predecessor companies — touted the breadth of their combined retail branch network. 7 But they were hardly alone. In 2003, some 215 deals were announced among U.S. commercial banks and bank holding companies for a total value of $66 billion, according to Thomson Financial, which tracks merger data. In July 2004, J.P. Morgan Chase and Bank One merged — as part of a 225-year journey — to form this exceptional company of ours: JPMorgan Chase. At its merger in 2004, the combined bank was the fourth largest bank in the world by market capitalization. But with patient groundwork over the years — fixing systems and upgrading technology, managing the notable acquisitions of Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual (WaMu) and continuing to reinvest, including in our talent — we have made our company an endgame winner. In earlier years, banks worried about their survival. While the past two decades have brought some virtually unprecedented challenges, including the great financial crisis and a pandemic followed by a global shutdown, they did not stop us from accomplishing extraordinary things. Our bank has now emerged as the #1 bank by market capitalization. Each of our businesses is among the best in the world, with increased market share, strong financial results and an unwavering focus on serving our clients, communities and shareholders with distinction and dedication. The strengths that are embedded in JPMorgan Chase — the knowledge and cohesiveness of our people, our long-standing client relationships, our technology and product capabilities, our presence in more than 100 countries and our unquestionable fortress balance sheet — would be hard to replicate. Crucially, the strength of our company has allowed us to always be there for clients, governments and communities — in good times and in bad times — and this strength has enabled us to continually invest in building our businesses for the future. You can see from the following charts what gains and improvements we have achieved along the way. 8 9 24_JD_earnings_diluted_ 03 DRAFT 3.14.24–TYPESET; 4/ 4/24; v.24_JD_earnings_diluted_03 Net income Diluted earnings per share (EPS) Return on tangible common equity (ROTCE) 2023202220212020201920182017201620152014201320122011201020092008200720062005 $8.5 $15.4 $17.4 $19.0 $21.3 $17.9 $21.7 $24.4 $14.4 $24.7 $24.4 $26.9 $38.4 $36.4 $37.7 $49.6$48.3 $32.5 15% 24% 22% 6% 10% 15%15% 15% 11% 13% 13% 12% 17% 19% 14% 23% 18% 21% 13% $4.00 $4.33 $1.35 $2.26 $3.96 $4.48 $5.19 $4.34 $5.29 $6.00 $6.31 $10.72 $15.36 $12.09 $16.23 $8.88 $9.00 $6.19 $2.35 $5.6 $11.7 $29.1 $39.1 1 Effective January 1, 2020, the Firm adopted the Financial Instruments - Credit Losses accounting guidance.

First and foremost may well be the impact of artificial intel - ligence (AI). While we do not know the full effect or the precise rate at which AI will change our business — or how it will affect society at large — we are completely convinced the consequences will be extraordinary and possibly as transformational as some of the major technological inventions of the past several hundred years: Think the printing press, the steam engine, electricity, computing and the Internet, among others. THE CRITICAL IMPACT OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE Since the firm first started using AI over a decade ago, and its first mention in my 2017 letter to shareholders, we have grown our AI organization materially. It now includes more than 2,000 AI/ machine learning (ML) experts and data scientists. We continue to attract some of the best and brightest in this space and have an exceptional firmwide AI/ML and Research department with deep expertise. We have been actively using predictive AI and ML for years — and now have over 400 use cases in production in areas such as marketing, fraud and risk — and they are increasingly driving real busi - ness value across our businesses and functions. We’re also exploring the potential that generative AI (GenAI) can unlock across a range of domains, most notably in software engineering, customer service and operations, as well as in general employee productivity. In the future, we envision GenAI helping us reimagine entire business work - flows. We will continue to experiment with these AI and ML capabilities and implement solutions in a safe, responsible way. While we are investing more money in our AI capa - bilities, many of these projects pay for themselves. Over time, we anticipate that our use of AI has the potential to augment virtually every job, as well as impact our workforce composition. It may reduce certain job categories or roles, but it may create others as well. As we have in the past, we will aggressively retrain and redeploy our talent to make sure we are taking care of our employees if they are affected by this trend. Finally, as a global leader across businesses and regions, we have large amounts of extraordinarily rich data that, together with AI, can fuel better insights and help us improve how we manage risk and serve our customers. In addition to making sure our data is high quality and easily accessible, we need to complete the migration of our analyti - cal data estate to the public cloud. These new data platforms offer high-performance compute power, which will unlock our ability to use our data in ways that are hard to contemplate today. Recognizing the importance of AI to our business, we created a new position called Chief Data & Analytics Officer that sits on our Operating Committee. Elevating this new role to the Operating Committee level — reporting directly to Daniel Pinto and me — reflects how critical this function will be going for- ward and how seriously we expect AI to influence our business. This will embed data and analytics into our decision making at every level of the com- pany. The primary focus is not just on the technical aspects of AI but also on how all management can — and should — use it. Each of our lines of business has corresponding data and analytics roles so we can share best practices, develop reusable solutions that solve multiple business problems, and continu- ously learn and improve as the future of AI unfolds. UPDATE ON SPECIFIC ISSUES FACING OUR COMPANY 17 Clearly, AI comes with many risks, which need to be rigorously managed. We have a robust, well-established risk and control framework that helps us proactively stay in front of AI-related risks, particularly as the regulatory landscape evolves. And we will, of course, continue to work hard with our regulators, clients and sub - ject matter experts to make sure we maintain the highest ethical standards and are transparent in how AI helps us make decisions; e.g., to counter bias among other things. You may already be aware that there are bad actors using AI to try to infiltrate companies’ sys- tems to steal money and intellectual property or simply to cause disruption and damage. For our part, we incorporate AI into our toolset to counter these threats and proactively detect and mitigate their efforts. OUR JOURNEY TO THE CLOUD Getting our technology to the cloud — whether the public cloud or the private cloud — is essential to fully maximize all of our capabilities, including the power of our data. The cloud offers many benefits: 1) it accelerates the speed of delivery of new ser- vices; 2) it simultaneously reduces the cost of com - pute power and enables, when needed, an extraor - dinary amount of compute capability — called burst computing; 3) it provides that compute capa - bility across all of our data; and 4) it allows us to be able to constantly and quickly adopt new tech - nologies because updated cloud services are con - tinually being added — more so in the public cloud, where we benefit from the innovation that all cloud providers create, than in the private cloud, where innovation is only our own. Of course, we are learning a lot along the way. For example, we know we should carefully pick which applications and which data go to the public cloud versus the private cloud because of the expense, security and capabilities required. In addition, it is critical that we eventually use multi - ple clouds to avoid lock-in. And we intend to main - tain our own expertise so that we’re never reliant on the expertise of others even if that requires additional money. We invested approximately $2 billion to build four new, modern, private cloud-based, highly reliable and efficient data centers in the United States (we have 32 data centers globally). To date, about 50% of our applications run a large part of their pro - cessing in the public or private cloud. Approxi - mately 70% of our data is now running in the pub- lic or private cloud. By the end of 2024, we aim to have 70% of applications and 75% of data moved to the public or private cloud. The new data cen - ters are around 30% more efficient than our exist- ing legacy data centers. Going to the public cloud can provide 30% additional efficiency if done cor- rectly (efficiency improves when your data and applications have been modified, or “refactored,” to enable new cloud services). We have been con - stantly updating most of our global data centers, and by the end of this year, we can start closing some that are larger, older and less efficient. ACQUIRING FIRST REPUBLIC BANK AND ITS CUSTOMERS The purchase of First Republic Bank was not some - thing that we would have done just for ourselves. But the regulators relied on us to step forward (we worked hand in hand with the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the U.S. Treasury), and the purchase of First Republic helped stabilize and strengthen the U.S. financial system in a time of crisis. The acquisition of a major company entails a lot of complexity. People tend to focus on the financial and economic outcomes, which is a reasonable thing to do. And in the case of First Republic, the numbers look rather good. We recorded an accounting gain of $3 billion on the purchase, and we told the world we expected to add more than $500 million to earnings annually, which we now believe will be closer to $2 billion. However, these results mask some of the true costs. First, approxi - mately one-third of the incremental earning was simply deploying excess capital and liquidity, which doesn’t require purchasing a $300 billion bank — we simply could have bought $300 billion of assets. Second, as soon as the deal was announced, approximately 7,600 of our employees went from working on tasks that would benefit the future of JPMorgan Chase to working on the UPDATE ON SPECIFIC ISSUES FACING OUR COMPANY 18 merger integration. Overall, the integration involves effectively combining more than 165 systems (e.g., statement, deposit, accounting and human resources) and consolidating policies, risk reporting, and other various rules and procedures. We hope to have most of the integration done by the middle of 2024. Fortunately, we were very familiar and comfort- able with all of the assets we were acquiring from First Republic. What we didn’t take on was First Republic’s excessive interest rate exposure — one of the reasons it failed — which we effectively hedged within days of the acquisition. Our people did a great job of respectfully manag - ing this transition, knowing that circumstances were particularly tough for our new colleagues, whom we tried to welcome with open arms. We did everything we could to redeploy individuals whose jobs were lost because of the merger (we directly hired over 5,000 people). Our approach has always been to go into an acquisition knowing we can learn things from other teams, and in this case, we did: First Republic had done an outstanding job serving high-net-worth clients and venture capital - ists, and we are developing what is effectively a new business for us following First Republic’s ser- vicing model. We will serve these high-net-worth clients through a single point of contact, supported by a concierge service model, across our distribu - tion channels — including more than 20 new J.P. Morgan branded branches. NAVIGATING IN A COMPLEX AND POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS WORLD In the policy section, we talk about how we may be entering one of the most treacherous geopolitical eras since World War II. And I have written in the past about high levels of debt, fiscal stimulus, ongoing deficit spending and the unknown effects of quantitative tightening (which I am more wor- ried about than most) so I won’t repeat those views here. However, the impacts of these geopo - litical and economic forces are large and some - what unprecedented; they may not be fully under- stood until they have completely played out over multiple years. In any case, JPMorgan Chase must be prepared for the various potential impacts and outcomes on our company and our people. We remain wary of economic prognosticating. While all companies essentially budget on a base case forecast, we are very careful not to run our business that way. Instead, we look at a range of potential outcomes for which we need to be pre - pared. Geopolitical and economic forces have an unpredictable timetable — they may unfold over months, or years, and are nearly impossible to put into a one-year forecast. They also have an unpre - dictable interplay: For example, the geopolitical situation may end up having virtually no effect on the world’s economy or it could potentially be its determinative factor. We have ongoing concerns about persistent inflationary pressures and consider a wide range of outcomes to manage interest rate exposure and other business risks. Many key economic indicators today continue to be good and possibly improving, including inflation. But when looking ahead to tomorrow, conditions that will affect the future should be considered. For example, there seems to be a large number of persistent inflationary pressures, which may likely continue. All of the following factors appear to be inflationary: ongoing fiscal spending, remilitarization of the world, restructuring of global trade, capital needs of the new green econ - omy, and possibly higher energy costs in the future (even though there currently is an oversupply of gas and plentiful spare capacity in oil) due to a lack of needed investment in the energy infrastructure. In the past, fiscal deficits did not seem to be closely related to inflation. In the 1970s and early 1980s, there was a general understanding that inflation was driven by “guns and butter”; i.e., fiscal deficits and the increase to the money supply, both partially driven by the Vietnam War, led to increased inflation, which went over 10%. The deficits today are even larger and occurring in boom times — not as the result of a recession — and they have been supported by quantitative easing, which was never done before the great financial crisis. Quantitative easing is a form of increasing the money supply (though it has many offsets). I remain more concerned about quantita - tive easing than most, and its reversal, which has never been done before at this scale. UPDATE ON SPECIFIC ISSUES FACING OUR COMPANY 19 Equity values, by most measures, are at the high end of the valuation range, and credit spreads are extremely tight. These markets seem to be pricing in at a 70% to 80% chance of a soft landing — modest growth along with declining inflation and interest rates. I believe the odds are a lot lower than that. In the meantime, there seems to be an enormous focus, too much so, on monthly inflation data and modest changes to interest rates. But the die may be cast — interest rates looking out a year or two may be predetermined by all of the factors I mentioned above. Small changes in interest rates today may have less impact on inflation in the future than many people believe. Therefore, we are prepared for a very broad range of interest rates, from 2% to 8% or even more, with equally wide-ranging economic outcomes — from strong economic growth with moderate infla - tion (in this case, higher interest rates would result from higher demand for capital) to a recession with inflation; i.e., stagflation. Economically, the worst-case scenario would be stagflation, which would not only come with higher interest rates but also with higher credit losses, lower business volumes and more difficult markets. Under these many different scenarios, our company would continue to perform at least okay. Importantly, being prepared means we can continue to help our clients no matter what the future portends. The mini banking crisis of 2023 is over, but beware of higher rates and recession — not just for banks but for the whole economy. When we purchased First Republic in May 2023 following the failure of two other regional banks, Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank, we thought that the current banking crisis was over. Only these three banks were offsides in having the toxic combination of extreme interest rate exposure, large unrealized losses in the held-to-maturity (HTM) portfolio and highly concentrated deposits. Most of the other regional banks did not have these problems. However, we stipulated that the crisis was over provided that interest rates didn’t go up dramatically and we didn’t experience a serious recession. If long-end rates go up over 6% and this increase is accompa- nied by a recession, there will be plenty of stress — not just in the banking system but with leveraged companies and others. Remember, a simple 2 percentage point increase in rates essentially reduced the value of most financial assets by 20%, and certain real estate assets, specifically office real estate, may be worth even less due to the effects of recession and higher vacancies. Also remember that credit spreads tend to widen, sometimes dramatically, in a recession. Finally, we should also consider that rates have been extremely low for a long time — it’s hard to know how many investors and companies are truly prepared for a higher rate environment. We seek to be engaged globally and carefully manage complex countries and geopolitical issues. JPMorgan Chase does business in more than 100 countries, and we have people on the ground in over 60 countries. In almost all those locations, we do research on their economy, their markets and their companies; we bank their government insti - tutions and their companies; and we bank multina - tional corporations, including the U.S. multina - tional corporations within their borders. This is a critical role — not only in helping those countries grow and improve but also in expanding the global economy. Many of these countries are quite complex with dif- ferent laws, customs and regulations. We are occa - sionally asked why we bank certain companies and even certain countries, particularly when countries have some laws and customs that are counter to many of the values held in the United States. Here’s why: • The U.S. government sets foreign policy. And when it does, we salute. Wherever we do busi - ness, we follow the law of the United States, as it applies in that country (in addition to the laws of the country itself), in all respects. Think of trade rules, sanctions, anti-money laundering and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, among others. By and large, these things help improve those coun - tries. In most cases, the U.S. government does not want us to leave because it agrees, gener - ally, that the engagement of American business enhances our relationships with other countries and helps those countries themselves. UPDATE ON SPECIFIC ISSUES FACING OUR COMPANY 20 • Engagement makes the world a better place. We all should want the world to continue to improve. Isolation and lack of engagement do not accomplish that goal. While we believe that it makes sense for the United States to push for constant improvement around the world — from advocating for human rights to fighting corrup - tion — this is rarely accomplished through coer - cion, and, in fact, is enhanced by engagement. • We need to be prepared for emerging challenges and position ourselves to under - stand them. We created a new role — Head of Asia Pacific Policy and Strategic Competitiveness — to focus specifically on key policy issues critical to the firm’s (and, in fact, the country’s) competitiveness, such as trade restrictions, supply chains and infrastructure. We also cre - ated a new strategic security forum to focus on emerging and evolving risks, including trade wars, pandemics, cybersecurity and actual wars, to name just a few. OUR EXTENSIVE COMMUNITY OUTREACH EFFORTS, INCLUDING DIVERSITY, EQUITY AND INCLUSION JPMorgan Chase makes an extraordinary effort as part of our “normal” day-to-day outreach to engage with individual clients, small and midsized businesses, large and multinational firms, govern - ment officials, regulators and the press in cities all around the world. This dialogue is part of the nor - mal course of business but it is also part of build - ing trust and putting down roots in a community. We believe that companies, and banks in particu - lar, must earn the trust of the communities and countries in which they operate. We believe — and we are unashamed about this — that it is our obliga- tion to help lift up the communities and countries in which we do business. We believe that doing so enhances business and the general economic well-being of those communities and countries and also enhances long-term shareholder value. JPMor- gan Chase thrives when communities thrive. This approach is integral to what we do, in great scale, around the world — and it works. We are quite clear that whether our efforts are inspired by the goodness of our hearts (as philanthropy or venture-type investing) or good business, we try to measure the actual outcomes. It’s also interesting to point out that many of our efforts were spawned from our work around Advancing Black Pathways, Military and Veterans Affairs, and our work in Detroit. While we’ve banked Detroit for more than 90 years, our $200 million investment in its economic recovery over the last decade demonstrated that investing in communities is a smart business strategy. We are one of the largest banks in Detroit, from consumer banking to investment banking, and it’s quite clear that not only did our efforts help Detroit, but they also helped us gain market share. The extent of Detroit’s remarkable recovery was recently high- lighted when Moody’s upgraded the city’s credit rating to investment grade — an extraordinary achievement just over 10 years after the city filed the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history. For JPMorgan Chase, Detroit was an incubator for developing models that help us hone how we deploy our business resources, philanthropic capi - tal, skilled volunteerism, and low-cost loans and equity investments, as well as how we identify top talent to drive successful business and societal improvements. I hope that, as shareholders, you are proud of our focus on promoting opportunity for all, both within and outside our organization, which includes economic opportunity. Some of our initiatives are listed below. • Business Resource Groups. To deepen our cul- ture of inclusion in the workplace, we have 10 Business Resource Groups (BRG) across the com - pany to connect more than 160,000 participat - ing employees around common interests, as well as to foster networking and camaraderie. Groups welcome anyone — allies and those with shared affinities alike. For example, some of our largest BRGs are Access Ability (employees with disabilities and caregivers), Adelante (Hispanic and Latino employees), BOLD (Black employees), NextGen (early career professionals), PRIDE (LGBTQ+ employees) and Women on the Move. UPDATE ON SPECIFIC ISSUES FACING OUR COMPANY 21 • Women on the Move. At JPMorgan Chase, they sure are! Women represent 28% of our firm’s senior leadership globally. In fact, our major lines of business — CCB, AWM and CIB, which would be among Fortune 1000 companies on their own — are all run by women (one with a co-head who is male). More than 10 years ago, a handful of senior women at the company, on their own, started this global, firmwide, inter- nally focused organization called Women on the Move. It was so successful that we expanded the initiative beyond the company; it now empowers clients and consumers, as well as women employees and their allies, to build their careers, grow their businesses and improve their financial health. The Women on the Move BRG has more than 70,000 employees globally. • Advancing Black Pathways. This comprehensive program, which just reached the five-year mark, focuses on strengthening the economic founda - tion of Black communities because we know that opportunity is not always created equally. The program does so by, among other accomplish - ments, helping to diversify our talent pipeline, providing opportunities for Black individuals to enter the workforce and gain valuable experi- ence, and investing in the financial success of Black Americans through a focus on financial health, homeownership and entrepreneurship. An important part of the program’s work is achieved through our investment in Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU). We now partner with 18 schools across the United States to boost recruitment connections, expand career pathways for Black students and other students, and support their long-term develop - ment and financial health. As a measure of the program’s success, in four years we have made nearly 400 hires into summer and full-time analyst and associate roles at the firm. • Military and Veterans Affairs. This firmwide effort sponsors recruitment, mentorship and development programs to support the military members and veterans working at JPMorgan Chase. Back in 2011, we joined with 10 other com- panies to launch the Veteran Jobs Mission (VJM), whose membership has since grown to more than 300 companies representing various industries across the United States and has hired over 900,000 veterans and military spouses. In 2023, VJM announced the creation of its Advisory Board, which is composed of 14 corporate lead- ers, to provide strategic direction and oversight of VJM as it continues to expand its commitment to support economic opportunities for veterans and military spouses, including its goal to hire 2 million veterans and 200,000 military spouses by 2030. JPMorgan Chase alone has hired in excess of 18,000 veterans since 2011 and currently employs more than 3,100 military spouses. • Creating opportunity for people with disabili - ties. The firm’s Office of Disability Inclusion continues to lead strategy and initiatives aimed at advancing economic opportunity for people with disabilities. In 2023, we joined lawmakers and business leaders in Washington, D.C., to show support for passage of the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) Savings Penalty Elimination Act. Modernizing the SSI program, by updating asset limits for the first time in nearly 40 years, would allow millions of people with disabilities who receive SSI benefits the opportunity to build their savings without put - ting their essential benefits at risk. We also provided business coaching to more than 370 entrepreneurs with disabilities. • Virtual call centers. When we sought to expand our customer service specialists program across the United States, we turned to Detroit, launch - ing our first virtual call center in 2022. Invest- ments in Detroit’s workforce development infrastructure helped us hire 90 virtual cus - tomer service specialists for a program that has outperformed many of our traditional call centers around the world. Following this suc- cess, we expanded our hiring efforts and this virtual program to Baltimore to create new jobs that jump-start careers. And now we’re evaluat- ing the possibility of expanding even further. UPDATE ON SPECIFIC ISSUES FACING OUR COMPANY 22 • Entrepreneurs of Color Fund. A critical chal - lenge we have seen in so many communities is that traditional lending standards render too many entrepreneurs — particularly entrepre - neurs of color and those serving these commu - nities — ineligible for credit. In response, we helped launch the Entrepreneurs of Color Fund (EOCF) in Detroit, a lending program designed to help aspiring small business owners gain access to critical resources needed for growth that are often not equitably available — capital, technical assistance and mentorship, among others. These challenges aren’t unique to Detroit so we worked with community development financial institutions to replicate the EOCF program in 10 markets across the United States in 2023, deploying more than 2,900 loans and $176 million in capital to underserved entrepreneurs across the country. • Senior business consultants. To help entrepre - neurs and small businesses make the transition from community lending to accessing capital from traditional financial institutions, we created a new job — senior business consultant — to provide support. Senior business consultants in branches that focus on underserved communi - ties offer coaching and help business owners with everything from navigating access to credit to managing cash flow to generating effective marketing. Since 2020, these consultants have mentored more than 5,500 business owners, helping them improve their operations, grow revenue and network with others in the local business community. • AdvancingCities. The organizing principles that define the business and community investments we make and how we best achieve an overall impact in local economies were heavily influ - enced by our experience in Detroit. Seeing Detroit’s comeback begin to take shape several years ago, we created AdvancingCities to repli- cate this model for large-scale investments to other cities around the world. From San Fran - cisco to Paris to Greater Washington, D.C., we’ve applied what we learned in Detroit to communi - ties where conditions are opportune for success and require deeper investments — where com - munity, civic and business leaders have come together to solve problems and get results. • JPMorgan Chase Service Corps . Ten years ago, we launched the JPMorgan Chase Service Corps to strengthen the capacity-building of nonprofit partners. We brought employees from around the world to Detroit to assist with its recovery — from creating a scoring model for a nonprofit to helping prioritize neighborhoods for develop - ment funding to devising an implementation plan for an integrated talent management system. Since that time, the Service Corps has expanded, with more than 1,500 JPMorgan Chase employees contributing 100,000 hours to support over 300 nonprofits globally. • Community Centers/Branches and Community Managers. A local bank branch, especially in a low-income neighborhood, can be successful only when it fits the community’s needs. That is why over the last several years we have shifted our approach to how we offer access to financial health education, as well as low-cost products and services to help build wealth. Since 2019, we have opened 16 Community Center branches, often in areas with larger Black, Hispanic or Latino populations, and have plans to open three more by the end of 2024. These branches have more space to host grassroots community events, small business mentoring sessions and financial health seminars, which have been well-attended — to date, over 400,000 people have taken advantage of the financial education seminars. In each of these Community Center branches, we hired a Community Manager (who acts as a local ambassador) to build relation - ships with community leaders, nonprofits and small businesses. The Community Manager concept and practice have become so successful that we have also placed these managers in many of our traditional branches in underserved communities. We now have 149 Community Managers throughout our branch network. • Work skills development. Detroit showed us how talent in communities is often overlooked. We saw this in the early days of our investment when we visited our partners at Focus: HOPE, a training program designed to help Detroiters develop skills for high-demand jobs. Quickly, it became clear that the training and education system in Detroit was disconnected from UPDATE ON SPECIFIC ISSUES FACING OUR COMPANY 23 employers and their talent needs. By investing in programs like Focus: HOPE, we have been able to help bridge local skills gaps by training people for in-demand jobs in communities like Dallas, Miami and Washington, D.C. Between 2019 and 2023, we supported more than 2 mil - lion people through our extensive learning and career programming around the world. • Increasing our rural investment. We are proud to be the only bank with branches in all 48 con - tiguous states, which include many rural com - munities. Nearly 17 million consumers living in rural areas hold over $100 billion in deposits with us and $175 billion in loans. We are also a leading wholesale lender in these communities, helping to fuel local economies through relation - ships with local companies, governments, hospi - tals and universities. Since 2019, we have made material progress in extending our footprint to reach more rural Americans, including expand - ing our branch network into 13 new states with large rural populations. Now we are raising the bar. With our new strategy, we have a goal to have a branch available to serve 50% of a state’s population within an acceptable driving dis- tance, including in heavily rural states such as Alabama and Iowa. This focus is part of our recently announced plan to build an additional 500 branches and hire 3,500 employees over the next three years. Through this expansion, we will partner across lines of business and our Corporate Responsibility organization to help advance inclusive economic growth and bring the full force of the firm to America’s heartland. We’ve nearly completed our five-year, $30 billion Racial Equity Commitment — it will now become a permanent part of our business. What began in 2020 as a five-year, $30 billion commitment is now transforming into a consistent business practice for our lines of business in support of Black, Hispanic, Latino and other underserved communities. By the end of 2023, we reported over $30 billion in progress toward our original goal. However, our focus is not on how much money is deployed — but on long-term impact and outcomes. And going forward, these programs will be embedded in our business- as-usual operating system. • Affordable rental housing. Through our Affordable Housing Preservation program, we approved program funding to date of approxi- mately $21 billion in loans to incentivize the preservation of over 190,000 affordable housing rental units across the United States. Addition - ally, we financed approximately $5 billion for the construction and rehabilitation of affordable rental housing. • Homeownership. In 2023, we expanded our $5,000 Chase Homebuyer Grant program to include over 15,000 majority Black, Hispanic and Latino communities — and in January 2024, we increased our grant amount to $7,500 in select markets. Since our grant program began in 2021, we have provided about 8,600 grants totaling $43 million. We also have provided home purchase and refinance loans in 2023 worth over $4.6 billion for more than 14,000 Black, Hispanic and Latino households across the economic spectrum. • Small business. The Business Card Special Purpose Credit Program, launched in January 2023, has provided over 10,900 cards, totaling over $43 million in available credit lines to underserved entrepreneurs and communities across the United States. UPDATE ON SPECIFIC ISSUES FACING OUR COMPANY 24 • Supplier diversity. In 2023, our firm spent approximately $2.3 billion directly with diverse suppliers — an increase of 10% over 2022. As a part of our racial equity commitment, over $450 million was spent in 2023 with more than 190 Black-, Hispanic- and Latino-owned businesses. • Minority depository institutions and commu - nity development financial institutions . To date, we have invested more than $110 million in equity in diverse financial institutions and pro - vided over $260 million in incremental financing to community development financial institutions to support communities that lack access to tradi - tional financing. JPMorgan Chase also helped these institutions build their capacity so they can provide a greater number of critical services like mortgages and small business loans. We’re thoughtfully continuing our diversity, equity and inclusion efforts. Of course, JPMorgan Chase will conform as the laws evolve. We will scour our programs, our words and our actions to make sure they comply. That said, we think all the efforts mentioned above will remain largely unchanged. And, in fact, around the world, cities and communities where we do business applaud these efforts. We also believe our initiatives make us a more inclusive company and lead to more innovation, smarter decisions and better financial results for us and for the economy overall. We are often asked in particular about “equity” and what that word means. To us, it means equal treatment, equal opportunity and equal access … not equal outcomes. There is nothing wrong with acknowledging and trying to bridge social and eco - nomic gaps, whether they be around wealth or health. We would like to provide a fair chance for everyone to succeed — regardless of their back - ground. And we want to make sure everyone who works at our company feels welcome. We want to articulate how we weigh in on social issues and what it means for our customers. Before I comment about culture issues, I have a confession to make: I am a full-throated, red- blooded, patriotic, free-enterprise (properly regu - lated, of course) and free-market capitalist. Our company is frequently asked to take a position on an issue, rule or legislation that might be consid - ered “cultural.” When that happens, we take a deep breath and study the matter. Many of the laws in question have many specific requirements, some of which you would agree with but not oth - ers. But we are being asked to support the entire law. In cases like these, we simply make our own statement that reflects our educated view and val - ues; however, we do not give our voice to others. We believe in the values of democracy, including freedom of speech and expression, and are staunchly against discrimination and hate. We have not turned away — and will not turn away — customers because of their political or religious affiliations nor would we tell customers how they should spend their money. Our commitment to these ideals is also reflected in our employees. The talent at our firm is a vibrant mix of cultures, beliefs and backgrounds. We are, of course, fully committed to freedom of speech. There are things that you can say that would be permitted under freedom of speech but would not be allowed under our Code of Conduct. For exam - ple, we do not allow intimidation, threats or highly prejudicial behavior or speech. Our Code of Con - duct clearly stipulates that certain statements and behavior, while allowed under freedom of speech, can lead to disciplinary action at our company — from being reprimanded to being fired. UPDATE ON SPECIFIC ISSUES FACING OUR COMPANY 25 WHAT WE LEARNED: A FIVE-POINT ACTION PLAN TO MOVE FORWARD ON THE CLIMATE CHALLENGE In May 2023, we gathered with knowledgeable and influential people from the energy industry writ large to the government and financial services arena in Scottsdale, Arizona, for an action forum. The goal was to explore various aspects of the climate challenge and try to devise effective solutions that could help lead to meaningful progress. The climate challenge is immense and complex. Addressing it requires more than making simplistic statements and rules; rather, energy systems and global supply chains need to be transformed across virtually all industries. And there is also a deep need for new research and development. Energy systems and supply chains provide the foundation of the global economy and must be treated with care. At the same time, the opportunity here is immense. The investment required to meet climate goals — estimated at over $5 trillion annually — could generate economywide growth and opportunity at a scale the world has not seen since the Industrial Revolution. The task for industry, policymakers and finance is to help formulate solutions that support the transition to a low-carbon economy, balancing affordable, reliable access to energy with generating economic growth. To find a way forward, we sought input from diverse stakeholders in pursuit of a North Star. In Scottsdale and in discussions with clients across industries about what’s needed to achieve a low-carbon economy, these five action steps and reforms were top of mind: • Supportive government policy and leadership to advance the transition. Policy that promotes favorable economic conditions to make the transition viable is a critical first step for clients. This includes government leadership via mandates, incentives or subsidies to support jobs and investment in the transition; actions on permitting and interconnection reform; and regulatory clarity and certainty, especially around long-term investments. As one vital example, current grid infrastructure is insufficient to accommodate the growth in renewables. • Public/private partnerships in scaling bankable projects. Scaling investments needs to happen both for commercially proven technologies (e.g., wind and solar) and for emerging technologies (e.g., green hydrogen, sustainable aviation fuel and carbon capture). Developing “bankable” clean energy projects will require the application of smart financial tools, as well as further policy support. It will take public/private partnerships and innovation to create catalytic forms of capital that can step into these gaps, absorb first-mover risks and provide the necessary funding. The cost of capital is too high for some companies — and public funds ought to be deployed in a smart way that effectively attracts private capital. • Public education and engagement. Without question, clients told us that public commitment to and investment in energy- related infrastructure is one of the most important parts of combating the climate crisis and running their businesses. Supporting the buildout of energy-related infrastructure with speed and scale is critical. Public acceptance of building and advancing the infrastructure needed to meet climate goals is at the heart of progress. While the energy transition is poised to deliver benefits to communities across the world, securing acceptance and support to build clean energy infrastructure at scale is challenging. Access to job-creating renewable energy projects can help rural communities thrive by advancing local economies. Ensuring public support and social license to operate requires better engagement strategies, including widespread stakeholder education about the benefits of these technologies for local communities. • Communication about concrete successes. Across industries, market participants need to do a better job of celebrating and championing concrete successes and tangible milestones. This includes highlighting success stories around emerging technologies and the complex nature of the carbon transition. Stakeholders also should better convey the benefits of clean energy — across all technologies — to help combat misinformation and foster a more informed dialogue. UPDATE ON SPECIFIC ISSUES FACING OUR COMPANY 26 • Work skills training. Businesses depend on healthy, thriving communities so the carbon transition needs to work for everyone. This includes helping to ensure that workers are trained in the skills for the future, such as through improved engineering schools and job training programs. Work across the entire supply chain is essential to moving at pace. As one example, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates we will need more than 70,000 additional electricians per year through 2031; it is currently unclear how the market will meet that demand. If the deployment of heat pumps and electric vehicle chargers accelerates, demand for electricians will be even higher. A concerted focus to train electricians can help the United States meet some of its climate goals while providing well-paying jobs that do not require a four- year college degree. Also, broadly speaking, businesses are in a better position to make investments with confidence when labor requirements across the value chain — from design and manufacturing to installation — are satisfied. We recently reconsidered certain memberships. JPMorgan Chase recently exited Climate Action 100+ and the Equator Principles. “Why?” we are asked. While we don’t necessarily disagree with some of the principles many organizations have, we make our own business decisions. We think we have some of the best-in-class environmental, social and risk standards because we have invested in our own in-house experts and matured our own risk management processes over the years. As a result, we are going to go our own way and make our own independent decisions, gathering the best learnings of experts in the field, and, of course, we will follow all legal requirements. We are engaged but recognize our role: three more important points. First, everyone should understand that conquering the climate problem needs proper government action, particularly around taxes, permitting, grids, infrastructure building and proper coordination of policies — we are not there yet. Second, there is no known technology that can fill the gap between our “aspirations” and the current trajectory of the world. We hope and believe that this will be found (for example, through carbon capture, improved batteries, hydrogen or other measures). This new technology will also require proper government research and development funding, as the effort cannot be accomplished by private enterprise alone. And third, we are going to use the word “commitment” much more reservedly in the future, clearly differentiating between aspirations we are actively striving toward and binding commitments . For JPMorgan Chase to play the right role in tackling the climate challenge, we have organized a special group around the green economy and related infrastructure investment. This group will coordinate and inform our work across all established industry groups (from auto to real estate, energy, agriculture and others) and includes hundreds of employees devoted to these efforts. UPDATE ON SPECIFIC ISSUES FACING OUR COMPANY 27 POWERING ECONOMIC GROWTH IN FLORIDA From Tallahassee to Miami and from Tampa to Palm Bay, JPMorgan Chase has been committed to Florida for more than 130 years and has enjoyed being the bank for all communities. Each year, we contribute billions of dollars to the economy, hire and train local residents, help to revitalize neighborhoods and remove barriers to opportunity for Floridians across the state. Our partnerships with businesses, nonprofits, government entities and community organizations have enabled us to drive sustainable impact and help them achieve their goals. We couldn’t be more proud to help make opportunity happen in Florida. This year, we forged a relationship with Inter Miami CF, one of the most recognizable sports teams in the world. Through this partnership and the newly named Chase Stadium, we’re continuing to contribute to South Florida and its local communities. In Tampa, home to nearly 6,000 of our employees, we’re triggering an additional $210 million in economic activity and creating over 660 local construction jobs through the renovation of our Highland Oaks campus and downtown Tampa office. We’re proud that one-third of all Floridians do business with us through deposits, credit cards or a mortgage. Through each of our investments across the state, we’re ensuring that residents have the resources and tools they need to thrive. Our support to government, higher education, healthcare and nonprofit organizations: • We serve over 150 government, higher education, healthcare and nonprofit clients throughout the state, and over the last five years, we have provided more than $20.2 billion in credit and capital to them. • Our clients range from the city of Jacksonville to the Orlando Utilities Commission, the University of South Florida, Broward Health and the District School Board of Pasco County — a decades-long client. • We are the lead treasury bank for the Wounded Warrior Project, one of the largest veteran service organizations in the United States. Headquartered in Jacksonville, the organization caters to wounded veterans and service members who served in the military on or after 9/11. Our support to investment and middle-market banking clients: • Over the last five years, we have provided in excess of $318 billion in credit and capital to local clients, such as utility, technology and tourism companies. • We have more than 12,500 large and midsized clients across the state. Our support to local financial firms: • Over the last five years, we have provided more than $24 billion in credit and capital for financial institutions, such as local banks, insurance companies, asset managers and securities firms. • We bank over 50 of Florida’s regional, midsized and community banks, helping them play an essential role in maintaining the state’s economy and serve local communities. UPDATE ON SPECIFIC ISSUES FACING OUR COMPANY 28 Our support to small business: • At the end of 2023, balances for loans extended to Florida’s small businesses totaled more than $1.2 billion — funds being used to help those businesses scale and grow, contribute to the economy and create local jobs. • Across the state, we have over 654,000 small business customers. • In 2023, our bankers and senior business consultants spent more than 375,000 hours advising and supporting Florida business owners. Our support to consumer banking needs: • We operate 1,445 ATMs and 410 branches across the state. • In 2023, we supported more than 6.1 million customers with mortgages, auto loans and savings, checking and credit card accounts, giving JPMorgan Chase one of the largest consumer banking market shares in the state. • We managed more than $70 billion in investment and annuity assets for local clients. Our business and community investments: • Over the last five years, we have committed nearly $65 million in philanthropic support, including: — $3 million to The Miami Foundation’s Resilient 305: Bu ilding Prosperity Collaborative to increase access to quality jobs and develop small businesses through training, investments and capacity-building. — $1.6 million to the Community Justice Project, which em powers community-based legal advocates to help delay displacement and improve conditions for housing stability for renters across nine Florida counties. • In 2022, we committed $10 million over five years to Tech Equity Miami to advance equal access to tech skills, careers and education, including: — A $1 million investment to Florida Memorial University, So uth Florida’s only HBCU, to help traditionally underresourced students pursue a career in technology. Our support as a local employer: • We employ more than 14,000 residents throughout the state, including nearly 1,900 veterans and over 660 people with a criminal background who deserve a second chance. • In Florida, the average salary of our employees is more than $87,000 (plus a starting comprehensive annual benefits package worth nearly $17,600) compared with the statewide per capita income of nearly $40,300. UPDATE ON SPECIFIC ISSUES FACING OUR COMPANY 29 GIVING THE BANK REGULATORY AND SUPERVISORY PROCESS A SERIOUS REVIEW The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank) was finished 14 years ago, and we believe it accomplished a lot of good things. But it’s been quite a while since then, and we’re still debating some very basic issues. It’s time to take a serious, hard, honest look at what has been done and what can be improved. It’s good to remember that the United States has the best financial system in the world, with diversi - fied, deep and experienced institutions, from banks, pension plans, hedge funds and private equity to individual investors. It has healthy public and private markets, transparency, rule of law and deep research. The best banking system in the world is a critical part of this, and, integrated with the overall financial system, is foundational to the proper allocation of capital, innovation and the fueling of America’s growth engine. This is not about JPMorgan Chase — we believe we can manage through whatever is thrown our way. This is about the impact on all parts of the system — from smaller banks to larger regional banks that may not have the resources to handle all of these regulatory requirements. It’s also about the effect on the financial markets and the economy from the rapidly growing shadow banking system, as well as the ultimate impact on the customers, clients and communities we serve. This is about what’s right for the system. The banking and financial system is innovative, dynamic and constantly changing. The banking system is not static: There are startup banks, mergers, successful upstarts and fintech banks, and even Apple, which effectively acts as a bank — it holds money, moves money, lends money and so on. Nonbanks are competing with tradi - tional banks, and, in general, this dynamism and churn are good for innovation and invention — with success and failure simply part of the robust pro - cess. Innovation runs across payments systems, budgeting, digital access, product extensions, risk and fraud prevention, and other services. Different institutions play different roles, and, importantly, small banks and big banks serve completely differ - ent strategic functions. Large banks bank multina - tional corporations around the world, make healthy markets, and wield technology and a prod - uct set that are the best in the world. A small bank simply cannot bank these same multinational gov - ernments and safely move the amount of money and securities that large banks do. Regional and community banks have exceptional local knowl - edge and presence and are critical in serving thousands of towns and certain geographies. It is also important to recognize that the banking system as we know it is shrinking relative to pri - vate markets and fintech, which are growing and becoming increasingly competitive. And remember that many of these new players do not have the same transparency or need to abide by the exten - sive rules and regulations as traditional banks, even if they offer similar products — this often gives them significant advantage. To deal with this fluid environment, banks of all sizes develop their own strategies, whether to specialize, expand geographically or embark on mergers and acquisitions. There are certain banking services where economies of scale are a competitive advantage, but not all banks need to become bigger to gain this benefit (there are many highly success- ful banks that are smaller). What is clear is that banks should be allowed to pursue their individual strategies, including mergers and acquisitions, as they see fit. Overall, this process should be allowed to happen — it’s part of the natural and healthy course of capitalism — and it can be done without harming the American taxpayer or economy. While we all want a strong banking and financial system, we should step back and assess how all the regulatory steps we have taken measure up against the goals we all share. Since Dodd-Frank was signed into law in 2010, thousands of rules and reporting requirements written by 10+ different regulatory bodies in the United States alone have been added. And it would probably be an understatement to say that some are duplicative, inconsistent, procyclical, contradictory, extremely costly, and unnecessarily painful for both banks and regulators. Many of the rules have unintended consequences that are not desirable and have negative impacts, such as increasing the cost of credit for consumers (hurting lower-income Americans the most). UPDATE ON SPECIFIC ISSUES FACING OUR COMPANY 30 The whole process, including the Base l III endgame, could be much more productive, streamlined, economical, efficient and safe. Both regulators and banks should want the same thing — a healthy banking system, serving its cli - ents and striving for continuous improvement. We all should also want the enormous benefits that would come from good collaboration between reg - ulators and bank management teams and boards. Over time, these relationships have deteriorated, and, again, are increasingly less constructive. There is little real collaboration between practi - tioners — the banks — and regulators, who gener - ally have not been practitioners in business. While we acknowledge the dedication of regulators who work with banks on a daily basis, management teams across the industry are putting in a disproportionate amount of time addressing requests for extra details, documentation and processes that extend far beyond the actual rules — and distract both regulators and management from more critical work. We should be more focused on the truly important risks for the safety of the system. And unfortunately, without collabo - ration and sufficient analysis, it is hard to be confi- dent that regulation will accomplish desired out- comes without undesirable consequences. Instead of constantly improving the system, we may be making it worse. A few additional points: • The Basel III endgame disadvantages American banks. The Basel III endgame has been 10 years in the making, and it still has not been completed. In my view, many of the rules are flawed and poorly calibrated. If the Base l III endgame were implemented in its current form, it would hamper American banks: As proposed, it would increase our firm’s required capital by 25%, making our requirement 30% higher than it would be under the equivalent European Union proposal. That means for every loan and asset financed in the United States by a major American bank, that bank would have to hold 30% more capital than any international com - petitor. The proposed regulations would also damage market making (see the following sec- tion). There are many other flaws but suffice it to say that much of the work being done today to analyze the effects should have been done before the proposed rulemaking. One of the single most important lessons from the great financial crisis is that there is enormous value to having a bank that is well-managed and has diverse revenue sources. Yet regulation since then both punishes consolidation and diversification — and punishes performance — through many features of the GSIB surcharge. • Built over many years, the framework is now full of duplication. The following is only a par- tial list: American gold-plating and conceptual inconsistencies among Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR), recovery and reso - lution plans, liquidity requirements, global sys - temically important bank (GSIB) requirements, and safety and soundness principles. The many overlapping rules contribute to the bureaucracy that generates an extraordinary amount of make-work (an 80,000-page CCAR and shock - ingly another, coincidentally, 80,000-page recovery and resolution plan). • The new rules do virtually nothing to fix what caused the failure of SVB and First Republic. For example, they don’t improve certain liquidity requirements, limit HTM accounting or reduce allowable interest rate exposure. • The current regulatory approach to liquidity might simply run counter to the stated intent. Regulations should recognize the value and importance of lending and borrowing against good collateral and using central bank resources, such as the discount window. Adhering to current liquidity requirements per- manently ties up good liquidity in a way that makes the system more fragile and more risky. • It is not clear what the full intent of the Basel III endgame was — it will have unintended con - sequences. Without real analysis of expected outcomes, additional regulation will likely reduce the number of banks offering certain services and increase costs for all market partic - ipants and activity, including loans, market making and hedging (by farmers, airlines and countries, among others). And new rules might even increase consolidation as companies race to achieve economies of scale in certain prod - ucts and services. UPDATE ON SPECIFIC ISSUES FACING OUR COMPANY 31 Unfortunately, some recent regulations are ending up in court. You can imagine that no one wants to sue their regulators. Banks would not sue if they did not think they were right — or if they thought they had any other recourse — which they effectively do not. This is definitely not what anyone should want. A more constructive relationship with regulators would reduce confusion and uncertainty and would lead to better outcomes for banks, their sharehold- ers, and their clients, customers and communities. Collaboration between banks and regulators could improve the use of resources and create better outcomes. True collaboration could dramatically improve the banking system. For example: • Redirect enormous resources from things that don’t matter to things that do. As mentioned, it takes 80,000 pages to describe a CCAR test and 80,000 pages to detail recovery and resolution. The talent and resources at the banks and regulators could be better used elsewhere. Such overload is distracting and takes your eye off the ball on real, emerging risks, including China, trade, payment systems and cybersecu - rity, among others. • Reduce bureaucratic processes that provoke a tendency to herd mentality. For example, CCAR is just a point-in-time stress test, and it can lull you into a false sense of security — for refer - ence, we do more than 100 stress tests each week. On interest rate exposure, focusing on the documentation of details may stop you from thinking about big interest rate exposure. Sometimes analyzing “what ifs” and fat tail risks is better than excessive and rigid models and documentations. • Examine risks outside the regulatory system that are rarely analyzed and largely unad - dressed. These risks include data and privacy, as well as consumer banking and payment sys - tems, which are growing fast in the unregulated market. In addition, there are potential risks from private credit markets (which I talk about later in the next section). • Let’s imagine what’s possible with real collabo- ration. Working together, we can improve how the FDIC manages failing institutions, how to limit contagion and restore confidence to depositors, how liquidity requirements can create more flexi- ble funding for banks under stress, how the bank- ing and Federal Reserve’s payment system can become more interoperable, how clearinghouse risk can be reduced, how stress tests can protect the system from a wider variety of outcomes, how costs and therefore consumer costs can be reduced (not increased), how anti-money laun- dering requirements can be simplified and improved at the same time, and how financial products can be brought to the unbanked. We can fix the housing and mortgage markets. For example, mortgage regulations around orig - ination, servicing and securitization could be simplified, without increasing risk, in a way that would reduce the average mortgage by 70 or 80 basis points. The Urban Institute estimates that a reduction like this would increase mortgage originations by 1 million per year and help lower-income households, in particular, buy their first home, thereby starting them on the best way to build household net worth. There are many more things that can be improved — and we really should start working on them. We need a detailed review and probably a complete revamp. I know this might be wishful thinking, but now would be a good time to step back and have a thor- ough and candid review of the thousands of new rules passed since Dodd-Frank. After this review, we should ask what is it that we really want: Do we want to try to eliminate the possibility of bank runs? Do we want to change and create liquidity rules that would essentially back most uninsured deposits? Do we want the mortgage business and leveraged lend- ing business to be inside or outside the banking sys- tem? Do we want products that are inside and out- side the banking system to be regulated the same way? Do we want to reasonably give smaller banks a leg up in purchasing a failing bank? And while Dodd- Frank did some good things, shouldn’t we take a look at the huge overlapping jurisdictions of various regulators? This overlap creates difficulties, not only for banks, but for the regulators, too. Any and all of this is achievable, and, I believe, could be accom- plished with simpler rules and guidelines and with- out stifling our critical banking system. UPDATE ON SPECIFIC ISSUES FACING OUR COMPANY 32 PROTECTING THE ESSENTIAL ROLE OF MARKET MAKING (TRADING) Before we discuss market making and financial markets, readers should understand that market making occurs in almost all businesses. There are healthy markets in farm animals, foreign prod - ucts, commodities, energy, logistics, healthcare and so on. Healthy markets increase customer choice and reduce cost. They almost always involve holding inventory and taking some risk, which is simply a part of the process. America’s financial markets are the biggest in the world — U.S. public debt and equity markets total $137 trillion, constituting the biggest “market” in the world, and are larger than America’s gross domestic product (GDP) of $27 trillion. Market participants are not “Wall Street.” They are large and small, mainly sophisticated, global inves - tors (pension plans, mutual funds, governments and individuals) representing retirees, veterans, individuals, unions, federal workers and others. They all benefit from our efficient, low-cost and transparent markets. Some regulators seem to think that market making is a speculative, hedge fund-like activity — and this thinking is what might be leading them to con- stantly increase capital requirements. The pro - posed capital rules could fundamentally alter market-making activities that are critical to a thriving economy, particularly in difficult markets when market making is even more important . The new rules would raise capital requirements by 50% for major banks — which could undermine market stability, make banking services costlier and less accessible, and push even more activity to a less regulated banking system. Our financial system and markets are the best in the world and benefit ALL participants; exceptionally good market making in the secondary market makes our primary markets the best in the world. We should recognize that the United States has the biggest, deepest and most liquid capital markets in the world. For these markets to function, it is critical for transparency and liquidity to be in the secondary market . Market making provides this, promoting the flow of capital to real economy investments and supporting all sectors of the economy, including companies, state and local governments, universities, hospitals, pension plans and overall job creation. Without market making in the secondary market, it would be extremely diffi - cult for companies to raise capital through the primary market — equity and debt offerings — which have totaled approximately $3.6 trillion on average over the past few years. The incredible strength of these markets enables companies of all sizes to grow and expand especially during times of volatility and stress. It also enables consumers to access cheaper credit and governments (local, state and federal) to reduce their borrowing costs. It takes enormous resources to properly support the Markets business. JPMorgan Chase spends $700 million per year in extensive research coverage of nearly 5,200 companies across 83 countries. This massive effort continuously educates investors and decision makers around the world and often leads to improved governance and management. It also critically complements the firm’s market-making activities and further promotes transparency, enabling investors to make thoughtful choices around investing in capital markets. I would also like our shareholders to know that our market making is backed by approximately $7 billion in support expenses, including over $2 billion in technology spend alone each year. This investment allows us to maintain global trading systems and constantly improve upon risk management and efficiency. JPMorgan Chase deploys approximately $70 billion in capital to maintain our Markets franchise. This capital supports $500 billion in securities inven - tory (largely hedged) — and this inventory allows us to buy and sell $2 trillion (notional) in securities daily for our clients. Market making entails risk but is not particularly speculative. The main objective of market makers is to continu - ously quote prices and diligently manage an inven - tory to transact at those prices, which includes assuming certain risks to support heavy volumes and orderly trading. Market makers have a moral obligation to try to make markets in good times UPDATE ON SPECIFIC ISSUES FACING OUR COMPANY 33 and in bad. Part of our brand promise is to stand ready as the willing buyer and seller. In this, we have never failed. In addition, in most cases regarding government debt, where we serve as a government securities dealer, we are legally obli- gated to make markets. This constant visibility into prices provided by market makers fosters investor confidence, keeps fees low and promotes economic growth by attracting more investors. Many large market participants — for example, hedge funds and high-frequency traders, among others — have no obligation to make markets. In fact, many of these market participants often “step out” of the markets and dramatically reduce liquid- ity specifically when market conditions are difficult. Market making is not particularly speculative since market makers generally hedge their positions, as you will see from some real life examples of the economics and risks. We earn revenue of approxi - mately $100 million on a typical day. In the aver- age year, the total is nearly $30 billion. On our $2 trillion in notional daily trading, this amounts to only one hundredth of a cent charged to the inves - tor for these services — an extraordinarily low cost compared with any other market in the world. Now let’s take a look at the actual risk and results versus the hypothetical risk and results. The hypo - thetical global market shock of the CCAR stress test has us losing $18 billion in a single day and never recovering any of it. Let’s compare that to actual losses under real, actual market stress. Now consider these historical data points: First, over the last 10 years, the firm’s market-making business has never had a quarterly loss and has lost money on only 30 trading days. These loss days represent only 1% of total trading days, and the average loss on those days was $90 million. Second, when markets completely collapsed during the COVID-19 pandemic (from March 2 through March 31, 2020, the stock market fell 16%, and bond spreads gapped out dramatically), J.P. Morgan’s market-making activities made money every day prior to the Federal Reserve’s major interventions, which stabilized the markets. During that entire month, we lost money on only two days but made $2.5 billion in Markets revenue for the month. And third, in the worst quarter ever in the markets fol- lowing the 2008 failure of Lehman Brothers, we lost $1.7 billion, but we made $5.6 billion in Markets rev- enue for the full year. The firm as a whole did not lose money in any quarter that year. In 2009, there was a complete recovery in Markets, and we made $22 billion in Markets revenue. You can see that our actual performance under extreme stress isn’t even close to the hypothetical losses of the stress test. Another major fallacy is that derivatives are objects of financial destruction. In reality, deriva - tives are an essential part of managing financial risk and are used by investors, corporations, farm - ers, businesses, countries, governments and oth - ers to manage their risks. And more than 85% of derivatives are fairly basic forms of foreign exchange or interest rate swaps. One last fallacy is that the repo markets are all about speculation. While it’s true that repo is used by certain investors to leverage up their positions, about 75% of repo is essential to normal money market functioning, i.e., is done by broker-dealers financing their actual inventory positions, money market funds investing their cash backed by highly rated collateral and clients hedging their positions. Market makers add confidence, liquidity and transparency to U.S. capital markets — market making helps stabilize markets and can reduce volatility. In addition, more liquidity, not less liquidity, will be needed to maintain market stability. Large banks keep an inventory of securities they can deploy in times of stress to help soothe markets; however, with the implementation of new regulations, banks now hold 70% as much inventory in securities as they did before the 2008 financial crisis, while the total size of the market has almost tripled. Higher capital requirements will accelerate this trend even further, impacting banks’ ability to deliver support to clients and markets in times when it is needed the most. UPDATE ON SPECIFIC ISSUES FACING OUR COMPANY 34 Washington’s Basel III endgame proposal damages market making, hurts Americans and drives activity to less transparent, less regulated markets. If this proposal is enacted as drafted: • Everyday consumer goods could be impacted. Households contending with inflation could also feel the effects of higher capital requirements on market-making activities when they shop. From beverage companies that need to manage aluminum costs to farms that need to protect against environmental risks, if the cost of hedg - ing those risks increases, it could be reflected in what consumers pay for everything from a can of soda to meat products. • Mortgages and small business loans will be more expensive. Consumers seeking a mort- gage — including first-time homebuyers and his - torically underserved, low- to moderate-income borrowers with smaller down payments — will face higher interest rates or will have a tougher time accessing one. This will occur not only because the cost of originating and holding these loans is higher but also because the cost of securitizing them will rise for banks, non - banks and government agencies. Not only that, but the proposal will likely lead to reductions in the size of unfunded credit card lines, which will put pressure on FICO scores and thereby make it more difficult for some people to access other forms of retail credit such as mortgages. Again, this will have the greatest impact on low- to moderate-income borrowers who rely most heavily on credit cards for day-to-day spending and to build their credit history. It could even be argued that existing regulations go too far and that there is an opportunity to help underserved communities by dialing down regulations that lead to higher borrowing costs. This should be studied and the pros and cons analyzed. The same can be said for small business loans, which will become more expensive and less accessible. • Saving for retirement or college will be harder. The cost of products that families count on to save for retirement or college will go up as a result of this proposal. Asset managers, money market funds and pension funds all buy, sell and safekeep securities and other financial instruments for American investors. Under the proposed rules, the cost of banking products used on behalf of clients each day — including brokerage, advisory, clearing and custody services — will go up and feed through to customers. That will lead to lower returns on retirement accounts, college funds and other long-term savings. • Government infrastructure projects and cor - porate development will become more expen - sive. Federal, state and local governments, as well as corporations and other institutions, rely on large banks for access to U.S. capital markets to fund development. If accessing capital mar- kets becomes more expensive, it will have a rip - ple effect on the hiring of American workers, investment in research and development, and funding to build hospitals, roads and bridges, including the planned infrastructure projects from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). More market activity will move to unregulated institutions, out of sight from regulators and with - out the same level of consumer protections that Americans expect from their banks. Other market participants that don’t have holistic client relation- ships are less likely to provide liquidity to help stabilize markets. In volatile times, banks have been able to interme - diate to help their clients and to work with the reg- ulators. With new regulations, they may be less able to do so. There have been several times in the past few years where banks had ample liquidity and capital but were unable to rapidly increase their intermediation in the markets due to very rigid liquidity and capital requirements. Finally, the proposed rules increase the chance that the Federal Reserve will have to step in again — and this is not something they should want to do on a regular basis but only in an extreme emergency. 35UPDATE ON SPECIFIC ISSUES FACING OUR COMPANY Staying Competitive in the Shrinking Public Markets In previous letters, I have described the diminish - ing role of public companies in the American finan - cial system. From their peak in 1996 at 7,300, U.S. public companies now total 4,300 — the total should have grown dramatically, not shrunk. Meanwhile, the number of private U.S. companies backed by private equity firms — which does not include the rising number of companies owned by sovereign wealth funds and family offices — has grown from 1,900 to 11,200 over the last two decades. This trend is serious and may very well increase with more regulation and litigation coming. Along with a frank assessment of the regulation landscape, we really need to consider: Is this the outcome we want? There are good reasons for private markets, and some good outcomes result from them. For exam - ple, companies can stay private longer if they wish and raise more and different types of capital with - out going to the public markets. However, taking a wider view, I fear we may be driving companies from the public markets. The reasons are complex and may include factors such as intensified report - ing requirements (including investors’ growing needs for environmental, social and governance information), higher litigation expenses, costly regulations, cookie-cutter board governance, shareholder activism, less compensation flexibility, less capital flexibility, heightened public scrutiny and the relentless pressure of quarterly earnings. Along with the universal proxy — which makes it easier to put poorly qualified directors on a board — the pressures to retreat from the public market are mounting. In addition, corporate governance principles are becoming more and more templated and formulaic, a negative trend. For example, proxy advisors may automatically judge directors unfavorably if they have a long tenure on the board, without a fair assessment of their actual contributions or experience. Another example is the constant battle by some proxy advisors who try to split the chairman and CEO role when there is no evidence this makes a company better off — in fact, today, lead directors generally hold most of the authorities previously assigned to the chairman. The governance of major corporations is evolving away from guidance by governance principles that focus on a company’s relationship to long-term economic value toward a bureaucratic compliance exercise. Good corporate governance is critical, and a little common sense would go a long way. THE PRESSURE OF QUARTERLY EARNINGS COMPOUNDED BY BAD ACCOUNTING AND BAD DECISIONS There is something very positive about detailed and disciplined quarterly financial and operating reporting. But company CEOs and boards of direc - tors should resist the undue pressure of quarterly earnings, and it is clearly somewhat their fault when they don’t. However, it is naïve to think that the pressure doesn’t exist because companies that “disappoint” can face extensive criticism, particu- larly those with a new or young CEO. It’s possible for companies to take short-term actions to increase earnings, such as selling more product cheaply at the end of a quarter, cutting certain investments that may be terrific but can show accounting losses in the first year or two, or just deploying more aggressive accounting methods at times. Once shortcuts like this begin, people all over the company understand that it is okay to “stretch” to meet your numbers. This could put you on a treadmill to ruin. Obviously, a company should not resort to these tactics, but it does happen in the public markets — and it’s probably less likely in the private markets. THE HIJACKING OF ANNUAL SHAREHOLDER MEETINGS One of the reasons it is less desirable to be a public company is because of the spiraling frivolousness of the annual shareholder meeting, which has devolved into mostly a showcase of grandstanding and competing special interest groups. We should 36 STAYING COMPETITIVE IN THE SHRINKING PUBLIC MARKETS treat shareholders with tremendous respect — and we do. At JPMorgan Chase, we are constantly talking with our investors — our directors, our lead director and our corporate governance experts visit most of our major investors whether they be direct owners or asset managers who manage the money for oth- ers. Meeting with your shareholders and investors is critical, but the annual shareholder meeting itself has become ineffective. We should try to come up with a far more constructive alternative. THE UNDUE INFLUENCE OF PROXY ADVISORS There are essentially two main proxy advisors in the United States. One is called Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS), and the second is called Glass Lewis. These proxy advisors started out providing reams of data from companies to help their institutional investor clients vote on proxy matters (information on executive compen - sation, stock returns, detail on directors, policies and so on). However, they soon also began to pro- vide advice on how shareholders should vote on proxy matters. And, in fact, institutional investors generally execute their voting on an ISS or Glass Lewis platform, which often includes a clear state - ment of the advisory service’s position. I should also point out, because it may be relevant, that ISS is owned by Deutsche Boerse, a German company, and Glass Lewis is owned by Peloton Capital, a Canadian private equity firm. I question whether American corporate governance should be determined by for-profit international institutions that may have their own strong feelings about what constitutes good corporate governance. While asset managers and institutional investors have a fiduciary responsibility to make their own decisions, it is increasingly clear that proxy advisors have undue influence. Asset managers (who manage money on behalf of others) and institutional investors (e.g., pension plans and endowments) may rely on a variety of information sources to support their valuation decision-making process. While data and recom - mendations may form pieces of the information mosaic, their votes should ultimately be based on an independent application of their own voting guidelines and policies. To the extent they use rec- ommendations from proxy advisors in their deci - sion-making processes, they should disclose that they do so and should be satisfied that the infor- mation upon which they are relying is accurate and relevant. However, many companies would argue that this information is frequently not balanced, not representative of the full view and not accu - rate. In addition, companies complain that they often cannot get the data corrected, and, there - fore, a vote may go uncorrected. Almost all asset managers receive proxy advisor data and recommendations; while some asset man- agers vote completely independently of this infor- mation, the majority do not. Most asset managers have formed corporate governance or stewardship committees that are responsible for their voting, and these committee positions are often held not by portfolio managers and research analysts (i.e., the people buying and analyzing the individual securi- ties) but by stewardship experts. While it is good to have stewardship experts, the reality is that many of these committees default large portions of what they do to proxy advisors and, more troubling, make it harder for actual portfolio managers to override this decision making. Some have argued that it’s too hard and too expen- sive to review the large number of proxies and proxy proposals — this is both lazy and wrong. If issues are important to a company, they should be important to the shareholder — for the most part, only a hand- ful of proposals are important to companies. We are making enhancements to J.P. Morgan Asset Management’s proxy voting processes to amplify the role of portfolio managers and to address the perception of asset managers’ reliance on third-party advisor voting recommendations. Enhancements to the firm’s internal proxy voting process will include: 37 STAYING COMPETITIVE IN THE SHRINKING PUBLIC MARKETS • More portfolio manager participation in proxy committee decision making. The firm has sig - nificantly expanded the representation of port - folio managers on its North American Proxy Committee in an effort to increase the diversity of viewpoints represented on the committee. As part of this change, and in recognition that port - folio managers, as fiduciaries, may differ in their views on how to vote on particular proposals depending on a mandate’s investment strategy and guidelines, we are broadening our capabili - ties to support voting results that may vary across our platform. • Diminished role of proxy advisor recommenda - tions. J.P. Morgan Asset Management makes its own independent proxy voting decisions (based on deep fundamental research) and stands behind the depth and rigor of its processes and historical information advantage. In most cases, the firm will only use proxy advisory firms for research, data and technical mechanics of vote transmission and not for outsourced recommen - dations. By the end of 2024, J.P. Morgan Asset Management generally will have eliminated third-party proxy advisor voting recommenda - tions from its internally developed voting sys - tems. Additionally, the firm will work with third- party proxy voting advisors to remove their voting recommendations from research reports they provide to J.P. Morgan Asset Management by the 2025 proxy season. • Other enhancements . We are working to give a company and its management even greater access to the ultimate decision makers; to raise critical issues to a company as early as possible in a constructive and proactive way; and to be willing to tell companies how we have voted once our decision is made rather than waiting until votes are finally counted. Taken together, these steps are designed to respond to a growing perception (and, I believe, reality) that the asset management industry gen - erally places undue reliance on proxy advisors in how proxies are voted. We believe these actions will strengthen our relationships with our clients and with companies while helping to build trust among shareholders, investors and companies. THE BENEFITS AND RISKS OF PRIVATE CREDIT I have already mentioned some of the benefits of private credit, and I’ll now mention some more. Many people in the private credit arena are very smart and creative and want to help the compa - nies they invest in navigate through market shoals. They can move quickly, discreetly and flexibly. Most generally understand that bad accounting drives bad decisions, and their goal is to make the right decisions for the future of the company. On the other hand, not all players are that good. And problems in the private credit market caused by the bad players can leak onto the good ones, even though private credit money is locked up for years. If investors feel mistreated, they will cry foul, and the government will respond by putting a laser focus on the business. It’s a reasonable assumption that at some point regulations will focus on the private markets as they do on the public markets. This scrutiny will include a look at how private credit values its assets, which isn’t as transparent as public market valuations. In addition, private market loans commonly lack liquidity in the sec- ondary market and are not generally supported by in-depth market research. New financial products that grow extremely rap - idly often become an area of unexpected risk in the markets. Frequently, the weaknesses of new products, in this case private credit loans, may only be seen and exposed in bad markets, which private credit loans have not yet faced. When credit spreads gap out, when interest rates go up and when some leveraged companies suffer in the recession, we will find out how those loans survive stress testing. In addition, they can create a little bit of a “credit crunch” for borrowers since it might be hard for private creditors to roll over loans under those conditions. Under stress condi - tions, private creditors would have to charge exor- bitant prices that companies simply cannot afford in order to book the new loan at par. Banks are in a slightly different position. 38 STAYING COMPETITIVE IN THE SHRINKING PUBLIC MARKETS panies through good times and bad, seeking to retain them as long-term clients across many areas of the bank. They can and do take “losses” that help the client maintain the franchise. But an asset manager must act as a “fiduciary” of other people’s money and cannot lend based on a moral obligation or potential future relationship. Recently, we have been witnessing a convergence between the public and private markets. But it’s too soon to say how this ultimately will play out, particularly if we go through a recessionary cycle. A BANK’S STRENGTH: PROVIDING FLEXIBLE CAPITAL Banks generally try to be there for their borrowers in difficult times — striving to roll over loans, rene - gotiate terms and raise additional capital. Banks do this for multiple reasons: They normally feel an obligation to help their clients, they have long- term relationships and they can commonly earn other sources of revenue from client-driven trans - actions. Banks can also flex their capital and lend - ing base as needed by their clients. This is because a bank can and should make decisions to help com - 39 24_JD_size of financial sector_0 8 DRAFT 3/27 /24TYPESET; 4/7 /24r1 v. 24_JD_size of financial sector_08 Size of the Financial Sector/Industry ($ in trillions) **FOOTNOTES –MOVED TO BACK PAGE 2007 2010 2023 Banks in the financial system Global GDP 1 Total U.S. debt and equity market Total U.S. broker-dealer inventories U.S. GSIB market capitalization U.S. bank loans U.S. bank liquid assets 2 Federal Reserve total assets Federal Reserve RRP volume $ 61.7 $ 54.2 $ 6.2 $ 0.9 $ 6.5 $ 1.4 $ 0.9 – $ 65.0 $ 55.9 $ 4.1 $ 0.8 $ 6.6 $ 2.8 $ 2.4 $ <0.1 $ 92.4 $ 137. 2 $ 4.9 $ 1.4 $ 12.4 $ 7.6 $ 7.7 $ 1.0 Shadow banks Hedge fund and private equity AUM 3 Top 50 sovereign wealth fund AUM 4 Loans held by nonbanks 5 U.S. money market funds 6 U.S. private equity-backed companies (K) 7 U.S. publicly listed companies (K) 8 Nonbank share of mortgage originations 9 Nonbank share of leveraged lending 10 Global private credit AUM 10 1996 7.3 $ 3.1 $ 2.7 $ 15.8 $ 3.1 4.9 4.6 12% 44% $ 0.2 $ 2.8 $ 4.1 $ 14.3 $ 3.0 6.0 4.2 9% 54% $ 0.3 $ 9.7 $ 12.0 $ 23.2 $ 6.4 11.3 4.3 69% 70% $ 1.6 Sources: FactSet, S&P Global Market Intelligence, Assets and Liabilities of Commercial Banks in the United States H.8 data, Financial Accounts of the United States Z.1 data, World Federation of Exchanges, Pitchbook, Preqin and World Bank.

BENEFITING FROM THE OODA LOOP The military, which often operates in extreme intensity of life and death and in the fog and uncertainty of war, uses the term “OODA loop” (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act — repeat), a strategic process of constant review, analysis, decision making and action. One cannot overemphasize the importance of observation and a full assessment — the failure to do so leads to some of the greatest mistakes, not only in war but also in business and government. A full assessment is critical. To properly manage any business situation, you need to perform a full and complete assessment of it. In business, you have to understand your competitors, their distribution, their economics, their innovations, and their strengths and weak - nesses. You also need to understand customers and their changing preferences, along with your own costs, your people and their skills. Then there’s knowing how other factors fit in, like tech- nology, risk, motivations … hope you get the point. For countries, you need a thorough grasp of their economies, strengths and weaknesses, population and education, access to raw materials, laws and regulations, history and culture. Research, data and analytics should be at a very detailed level and constantly reassessed. Only after you complete this diligent study can you start to make plans with a high degree of success. Get on the road — it builds knowledge and culture. I have frequently wondered about all the nonstop road trips, client meetings, briefings, greetings, bus trips, and visits to call centers, operating centers and branches, regulators and government officials, among others: Did they make a differ- ence? The answer is absolutely yes because they enabled a process of constant learning, assess - ment and modification of best practices — gaining insights from employees to clients to competitors. Employees will tell you what you are doing well or poorly if you simply ask them, and they know you want to hear the real answer. Curiosity is a form of humility — acknowledging that you don’t know everything. Responding to curiosity allows other people to speak freely. Facts and details matter and inform a deeper and deeper analysis that allows you to continually revise and update your plans. This, of course, also means that you are constantly admitting prior mistakes. You need to shed sacred cows, seek out blind spots and challenge the status quo. Very often companies or individuals develop nar - ratives based upon beliefs that are very hard to dislodge but are often wrong — and they can lead to terrible mistakes. A few examples will suffice. Stripe, Inc. built a payments business by working with developers — something we never would have imagined but might have figured out if we had tried to seek out what others were doing in this area. Branches were being closed, both at Bank One and Chase, because the assumption was that they would not be needed in the future. We underinvested for years in the wealth man - agement business because we were always focused on the value of deposits versus invest - ments. Question everything. Management Lessons: Thinking, Deciding and Taking Action – Deliberately and with Heart 40 MANAGEMENT LESSONS: THINKING, DECIDING AND TAKING ACTION — DELIBERATELY AND WITH HEART Use your brains to figure out the truth — not to justify what you already think. It’s often hard to change your own attitudes and beliefs, especially those you may have held on to for some time. But you must be open to it. When you learn something that is different from what you thought, it may affect many conclusions you have, not just one. Try not to allow yourself to become rigid or “weaponized,” where other employees or interest groups jazz you up so much that you become a weapon on their behalf. This makes it much harder to see things clearly for yourself. When people disagree with you, seek out where they may be partially right. This opens the door for a deeper understanding and avoids binary thinking. It’s hard to see certain long-term trends, but you must try. There is too much emphasis on short-term, monthly data and too little on long-term trends and on what might happen in the future that would influence long-term outcomes. For example, today there is tremendous interest in monthly inflation data, although it seems to me that every long-term trend I see increases inflation relative to the last 20 years. Huge fiscal spending, the trillions needed each year for the green economy, the remilitariza - tion of the world and the restructuring of global trade — all are inflationary. I’m not sure models could pick this up. And you must use judgment if you want to evaluate impacts like these. Also, a block of time as short as one year is an arti - ficial framework for judging the impact of long- term trends that could easily play out over years. A helpful exercise is to think “future back,” in which you imagine different future outcomes, including the ones you want, and then work back - ward to events that are happening today (or that might happen or that you cause to happen), closely examining the connections between those events and your projected or desired outcomes. Those connections inform your risk and R&D planning. Similarly, when companies compare the attributes of their products and services with their competi - tors, they usually only consider where they are versus their competitors. But nothing is static — they should consider where their competitors will be in the future. Conditions are always changing, crises are always emerging. When analyzing the playing field, it is better to assume that your com - petitors are strong and are already in the process of improving and innovating. This minimizes the chance of arrogance leading to complacency. DECISION MAKING AND ACTING (HAVE A PROCESS) There is a time for an individual to decide and act. Sometimes you should take the time to measure twice and cut once. And then sometimes making a quick decision is better than delaying. You should try to distinguish between the two. For example, with decisions that are hard to reverse, it’s usually better to go slow. With other decisions where you can test, learn, probe and change direction, it’s often better to go fast. It’s been my experience that it’s hard for some people to actually decide and act. This could be from analysis paralysis, lack of “perfect” information, fear of failure or the feel- ing that full consensus is needed before a decision can be reached. But whatever it is, it can slow down and possibly seriously damage a company. To get people to think like decision makers and take a strong point of view, we like to ask, “What would you do if you were king or queen for a day?” It helps shift the direction to individual decision making. We also ask questions like, “What would 41 MANAGEMENT LESSONS: THINKING, DECIDING AND TAKING ACTION — DELIBERATELY AND WITH HEART you wish for if you knew X was going to happen?” (for example, higher interest rates). Decision making takes a mix of courage, grit and guts. One exercise that I find useful (and sometimes painful) is to draw up a list of important decisions that need to be made — the ones I often avoid con - fronting. So I take time every Sunday to think about these tough issues and almost always make progress. Progress doesn’t always mean that you come to the final conclusion — sometimes it’s just a very rational next step that can put you on a path to the final decision. Try to have a good decision-making process. Try to give yourself the time to decide. Make sure you speak with the right people and make sure the right people are in the room. Information should be fully shared. People should be made very com - fortable with open debate. Quite often, the “right” answer is simply waiting to be found — you don’t have to guess. Crowdsourcing, compromise, consensus and committees have benefits and risks. There are huge benefits to crowdsourcing intelli - gence. It is a form of full assessment, a strategy for getting the best ideas and challenging the sta - tus quo. We should do this for almost every major decision. It is perfectly fine on some occasions to compromise and gain consensus, particularly on decisions that are not critical and can easily be reversed. Often people spend too much time debating issues that are simply not that import - ant; it’s better to decide and move on. Also, before you compromise, you should know exactly what you want to achieve and the consequences of any tradeoffs. However, sometimes compro - mise and consensus cannot work and only lead to a feel-good decision that is probably wrong — this could be the road to ruin. The use of committees can be good when done properly. For example, if our risk committees could do a full assessment and crowdsource all potential risks, that would lead to better decision making. I will give one very personal and painful example, which is when we had a major trading scandal, called The London Whale. The scandal was not caused by the complexity of the trade but rather the failure to go to the proper Risk com - mittee for a thorough review, which should have happened but didn’t. I have no doubt that had the trade been raised there, the flaws would have been exposed immediately, thereby dramatically reducing or eliminating the problem. On the other hand, the opposite can happen when a commit - tee, with everyone staring at each other, devolves into herd-like behavior with people looking for confirmation and ending up with a compromise that is a poor choice. Good leadership involves great observation and the ability to act, but there is more … THE SECRET SAUCE OF LEADERSHIP (HAVE A HEART) You need to earn trust and respect with your employees. You can be great at assessment, you can be bril - liant and you may often be willing to act. But all of that is not good enough for “complete” leadership. To become a true leader, you need to be trusted and you must earn your respect, every day. People have to know that you do not have ulterior motives and that you’re trying to do the right thing — not trying to burnish your personal reputation. Good people want to work for people they respect, and they will not respect people who take all the credit and share all the blame. People need to know that even when you make mistakes, you’re willing to admit them and take corrective action. And there is more … 42 MANAGEMENT LESSONS: THINKING, DECIDING AND TAKING ACTION — DELIBERATELY AND WITH HEART The importance of vision, communication and inspiration. The reason I’ve always hesitated to talk about “vision” is because often it is the basic BS of corporate speak — that somehow if you impart your vision to people, they will take the mountain. What it really is all about is this: After you’ve done your full assessment and decision making, you can then continuously educate, explain, train, simplify, propel and fight. But this only works if people know you are in the trenches with them, if they understand the mission and if they are there side by side with your effort. We know that bureaucracy can lead to politics, corporate stasis and terrible decisions. So you can communicate your vision about how to fight bureaucracy by telling stories about the silly things we do — but with a smile — and then by showing people that you will actually fix the problems. Finally, your vision needs to be clear, coherent and consistent. Within an organization, people very quickly pick up the pattern of management saying one thing but doing another. Because if words and actions are inconsistent (for example, and I could give many, when we say we want employees to be treated with respect, but we allow a jerk to be their boss), confidence in leadership will be eroded. Heart cannot be overstated. Heart matters. And it makes a difference when people know and see that you actually care. One example: Many years ago when I was new to JPMorgan Chase, I learned that the company’s security guards had been outsourced — to save money. Since after outsourcing, when the same guards continued coming to work every day at the same salary, I wondered, “How could this be?” (FYI, this was brought to my attention by the head of the Service Employees International Union, who came to see me over the objection of my manage - ment team.) The reason we were saving money is because the healthcare benefits were cut in half for the guards and their family members (currently worth approximately $15,000 a year), and the sav - ings were split with us. This was a heartless thing to do — and the second I found out, I reversed the decision. JPMorgan Chase’s success will not be built off the backs of our guards — it will be the result of fair treatment of all of our employees — and we’re thankful that many of those guards are still with our company today. You know heart and soul when you see it in effect on sports teams or with “the boys in the boat” — it’s a beautiful thing to watch. It’s not as obvious, but it happens in business, too. It’s essential to build trust with your customers, constituencies and, yes, even competitors. Of course, I’m not bringing this up as a matter of corporate governance or a corporation’s purpose: A business should, over the long run, try to maxi - mize shareholder value. It is completely obvious that running a decent business —treating everyone ethically and earning trust and respect in all your communities — is not only fundamental to share - holder value but also to a healthy society. 43 MANAGEMENT LESSONS: THINKING, DECIDING AND TAKING ACTION — DELIBERATELY AND WITH HEART A Pivotal Moment for America and the Free Western World: Strategy and Policy Matter In past years, I have written extensively about pub - lic policy issues. It is important to engage in these conversations, particularly around domestic economic policy because policy matters. While JPMorgan Chase can execute specific plans to improve outcomes for customers and communi - ties, there is no replacement for effective govern - ment policies that add to the general well-being of the country. A stronger and more prosperous country will make us a stronger company. As CEO of this company, every year I visit numer- ous countries around the globe. I meet with for- eign government leaders, presidents and prime ministers, business leaders, and civic and aca - demic experts, which allows me to learn a signifi - cant amount about how public policy is executed around the world. It also reinforces some of the critical values and virtues that are essential to a healthy country. Every time I see the American flag, it reminds me of the values and virtues of this country and its founding principles conceived in liberty and dedi - cated to the notion that all men and women are created equal. Talk with someone who has recently become a naturalized citizen or watch a ceremony where groups of people take the oath to America, and you will see extraordinary joy and newfound pride. They now live free, with individual rights protected by the Constitution and with their life and the well-being of their family and community protected by the U.S. military. As Americans, we have much to be grateful for and much to defend. If you read the newspaper from virtually any day of any year since World War II, there is abundant coverage on wars — hot and cold — inflation, reces - sion, polarized politics, terrorist attacks, migration and starvation. As appalling as these events have been, the world was generally on a path to becom - ing stronger and safer. When terrible events happen, we tend to overestimate the effect they will have on the global economy. Recent events, however, may very well be creating risks that could eclipse anything since World War II — w e should not take them lightly. February 24, 2022 is another day in history that will live in infamy. On that day, 190,000 Russian soldiers invaded a free and democratic European country — importantly, somewhat protected by the threat of nuclear blackmail. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent abhorrent attack on Israel and ongoing violence in the Middle East should have punctured many assumptions about the direction of future safety and security, bringing us to this pivotal time in history. America and the free Western world can no longer maintain a false sense of security based on the illusion that dicta - torships and oppressive nations won’t use their economic and military powers to advance their aims — particularly against what they perceive as weak, incompetent and disorganized Western democracies. In a troubled world, we are reminded that national security is and always will be para - mount, even if its importance seems to recede in tranquil times. The fallout from these events should also lay to rest the idea that America can stand alone. Of course, U.S. leaders must always put America first, but global peace and order are vital to American interests. Only America has the full capability to lead and coalesce the Western world, though we must do so respectfully and in partner - ship with our allies. Without cohesiveness and unity with our allies, autocratic forces will divide and conquer the bickering democracies. America needs to lead with its strengths — not only its 44 A PIVOTAL MOMENT FOR AMERICA AND THE FREE WESTERN WORLD: STRATEGY AND POLICY MATTER military but also its economic, diplomatic and moral forces. And now we must do so as America’s leadership is being challenged around the world. There is nothing more important. Policy and strategy matter, and it’s important to be engaged. In our increasingly complex world, there is a vital interrelationship between domestic and foreign economic policy, particularly around trade, invest- ment, national security and other issues. And, of course, while American voters and leadership set U.S. foreign policy, being a constructive part of the global conversation has become more important than ever. If you doubt how important public policy is for the health of a country, you need to look no further than the recent history of Greece, Ireland or Singapore. Each of these countries, starting from deeply challenging places, implemented effective government and policies that have done a great job of lifting up their people when many thought it wasn’t possible. Sweden is another great example of a country with good broad-based policies that have succeeded at precisely what we all may want — a dynamic, innovative, free-market economy (Sweden actually has fewer government-owned enterprises than America) and safety nets that work. Conversely, you need to look no further than North Korea or Venezuela to see the complete destruction and havoc that terrible public policies (often in the name of the people) can cultivate. Strategy by its nature must be comprehensive. In the rest of this section, I try to answer the question: What must we do to ensure that the world stays safe, not only for America but for freedom and democracy? A comprehensive strategy entails four important pillars, and we must succeed at each: 1. Maintain American leadership (including military). 2. Achieve long-term economic success with our allies. 3. Strengthen our nation domestically. 4. Deepen focus and resolve on addressing our most pressing challenges. COALESCING THE WESTERN WORLD — A UNIQUELY AMERICAN TASK Only America has the full capabilities of military might, economic power and the principles that most people around the world yearn for — based on “liberty and justice for all” and the proposition that all people are created equal. America remains the bastion of freedom and the arsenal of democracy. There is no alternative to American leadership. In the free and democratic Western world, and, in fact, for many other countries, there is no real or good alternative to America. The only other poten - tial superpower is China. Other nations know they can rely on the founding principles of America. If we reach out our hand, most nations will happily take that hand. America is still the most prosper - ous nation on the planet, which not only can guar- antee our military strength but also positions us to help our allies develop and grow their nations (though we should minimize the “our way or the highway” type of behavior). This leadership is needed today to help Ukraine stay free in its battle with Russia. Most of the world wants American leadership. America continues to be the envy of much of the world, and as we’ve seen with the challenges at our borders, there is a reason people want to come here and not to autocratic nations. If you opened America’s borders to the rest of the world, I have little doubt that hundreds of millions of people would want to move here. By contrast, not many would want to emigrate to autocratic nations. Also, I have little doubt that if most inves - tors across the globe could only invest in one coun - try, they would choose the United States. Beyond our country’s borders, people and nations around the world understand the role that America has played in promoting world peace — known as Pax Americana. For the most part, Pax Americana has kept the world relatively peaceful since World War II and helped lead to enormous global economic prosperity, which has helped lift 1.3 billion people out of poverty. 45 A PIVOTAL MOMENT FOR AMERICA AND THE FREE WESTERN WORLD: STRATEGY AND POLICY MATTER Modern America does not engage in economic coercion or foreign wars to steal land or treasure. The fact that some of our foreign excursions might have been misguided does not negate this. We helped rebuild Europe and Japan after the devas - tation of World War II, and we, with our allies, have helped create global institutions to maintain peace. We are still trusted. First and foremost, the Western world needs unquestioned military might — peace through strength. “We know only too well that war comes not when the forces of freedom are strong, but when they are weak,” said Ronald Reagan in 1980. So far, the Western world has done a good job in strengthening military alliances in response to the war in Ukraine. Ukraine is essentially the front line that needs immediate support. Providing that sup- port is the best way to counter autocratic forces that would seek to weaken the Western world, par- ticularly America. But the ongoing wars in Ukraine and the Middle East could become far worse and spread in unpredictable ways. Most important, the specter of nuclear weapons — probably still the greatest threat to mankind — hovers as the ultimate decider, which should strike deep fear in all our hearts. The best protection starts with an unyield- ing resolve to do whatever we need to do to main- tain the strongest military on the planet — a com- mitment that is well within our economic capability. American leadership requires not only the military but also the full “symphony of power.” Former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, in his book Exercise of Power, writes extensively in the first chapter about “the symphony of power.” He makes the critical point that America has often overused and misused military power and has massively underused other muscles — diplomacy, intelligence, communication (explaining to the world the benefits of democracy and free enter - prise) and comprehensive economic policy. America has the most extensive group of partners, friends and allies — both military and economic — that the world has probably ever seen. We should put this to better use. The American public ought to hear more about why this is so important. International isolationism has run through American foreign policy throughout our history, frequently with good reason. The chant, “Don’t get involved in foreign wars” was often right. That said, the American public should remember that even after the Revolutionary War, we did, in fact, have British and French armies on our soil. The sinking of American merchant and passenger ships during World War I and the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor in World War II brought isolationism to a close for a time. America is never far from being dragged into terrible conflicts. Global wars come to our shores whether we like it or not — we need to stay engaged. In perilous periods of history when our allies and other democracies were under serious assault, great American leaders have inspired the Ameri - can people — through words and actions — to stand up to help and defend them. Staying on the sidelines during battles of autocracy and democ - racy, between dictatorship and freedom, is simply not an option for America today. Ukraine is the front line of democracy. If the war goes badly for Ukraine, you may see the splintering of Pax Americana, which would be a disaster for the whole free world. Ukraine’s struggle is our strug- gle, and ensuring their victory is ensuring America first. It is imperative that our national leaders explain to the American people what is at stake and make a powerful case – with energy, consis- tency and clarity – for our strong enduring com - mitment to Ukraine’s survival for as long as it takes (and it could take years). One last point: Ukraine needs our help immediately, but it’s important to understand that much of the money that America is directing to Ukraine is for purchasing weapons and equipment, most of which will be built in America. Not only is our aid helping Ukraine, but it is going directly to American manu- facturers, and it is helping the country rebuild our military industrial capacity for the next generation. 46 A PIVOTAL MOMENT FOR AMERICA AND THE FREE WESTERN WORLD: STRATEGY AND POLICY MATTER STRENGTHENING OUR POSITION WITH A COMPREHENSIVE, GLOBAL ECONOMIC SECURITY STRATEGY Sustaining America’s economic strength is a bed- rock for our long-term military strength. There are many things we need to do to strengthen the U.S. economy, and I talk about that later in this section. This discussion is about foreign economic policies — the economic battlefield. The whole Western world is rethinking and reimagining its military strategies and alliances. We need to do the same for our economic strate - gies and alliances, but we should be guided by a comprehensive global strategy that deals with critical issues. Done properly, such a strategy would help strengthen, coalesce and possibly be the glue that holds together Western democratic alliances over decades. Foreign economic policy involves trade and invest- ment, export controls, secure and resilient supply chains, and the execution of sanctions and any related industrial policies. It must also include development finance — think of the “Belt and Road” efforts in China — which are critical to most develop- ing nations. This framework should tell us not only how to deal with our allies but also how to work with nonaligned nations around the world. These strate- gies should not be aimed against any one country (such as China) but rather be focused on keeping the world safe for democracy and free enterprise. Economic national security is paramount — both for the United States and for our allies. It is a valid point that the Western world — both government and business — essentially underesti - mated the growing strength and potential threat of China. It’s also true that China has been compre- hensively and strategically focused on these eco - nomic issues, all while we slept. But let’s not cry over spilled milk — let’s just fix it. We missed the potential threat from three vantage points. The first is companies’ overreliance on China as the sole link in their supply chain, which can create vulnerabilities and reduces resiliency. But to the extent this involves everyday items, like clothes, sneakers, vaccine compounds and con - sumer goods, this dependency is not as critical or complex and will eventually be sorted out. The second is the most critical. The United States cannot rely on any potential adversaries for mate - rials essential to our national security — think rare earths, 5G and semiconductors, penicillin and materials critical to essential pharmaceuticals, among others. We also cannot be sharing vital technologies that can enhance an adversary’s military capabilities. The United States should properly and narrowly define these issues and then act unilaterally, if necessary, to fix them. The third is also complex, which is countering unfair competition or “mercantilist” behavior in critical industries; think electric vehicles, renew - able energy and AI, among others. Examples of this would be where a state, any state, uses gov - ernment powers, capital, subsidies or other means to dominate critical industries and deeply damage the economic position of other nations. Weakening a country economically can render it a virtual “vassal state,” reliant on potential adversaries for essential goods and services, which also weakens it militarily. We cannot cede our important resources and capabilities to potential adversaries. All these issues can be resolved, though they will take time and need devoted effort. Every nation will have different national security issues. For example, Europe in general and coun - tries like India, Japan and Korea need reliable, affordable and secure energy; many nations would put food security as their top concern. This means that we must work with our allies to accomplish our own goals and to help them accomplish theirs. We have extraordinary common interests in our joint security: We must hang together — because if we don’t, we will assuredly hang separately. We already engage in trade — improving it is good economics and great geopolitics. We must have a better understanding of trade. As a nation, we refuse to get into genuine trade discussions, but this ignores the complete and obvious truth — we already have trade relation - ships with all these countries. Approximately 92% 47 A PIVOTAL MOMENT FOR AMERICA AND THE FREE WESTERN WORLD: STRATEGY AND POLICY MATTER of the world’s consumers live outside the United States. Increased trade allows our workers and farmers to access those markets. We should nego - tiate trade agreements that can achieve more, economically, for ourselves and our allies, as well as meet all of our national security needs. While it is appropriate to use trade to continue to nudge allies in the right direction around human rights and climate, this objective should be subordinated to our national interests of long-term security. Negotiating must be done in concert with our allied nations so as not to cause a fissure in economic relations. This is critical — strong economic bonds will help ensure strong military alliances. The Infla- tion Reduction Act has much good in it (more on this later), but it angered many of our allies. To them, the bill was by America and for America, and, sub- sequently, they felt a need to match it so their busi- nesses would not be disadvantaged. The terms of the legislation could have been better negotiated with our allies in mind, strengthening our economic ties with the free world. We should also immediately re-enter, if possible, the prior negotiated Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement. Not only is it good for the economy, but it also could be a brilliant, strategic, economic security move — an economic alliance that binds us with 11 other important countries (including Australia, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, Singa - pore and Vietnam). Geopolitically and strategically, this might be one of the most important moves to counter China. While this is a challenging step, our political leaders need to explain and lead — and not be afraid of dealing with the tough issues. We also need to acknowledge that there have been real negative job impacts as a result of trade, which are usually concentrated around certain areas and businesses. So any new trade policy should be combined with a greatly enhanced Trade Adjustment Assistance program, which provides retraining, income assistance and relocation for those workers directly impacted by trade. Trade is realpolitik, and the recent cancellation of future liquified natural gas (LNG) projects is a good example of this fact. The projects were delayed mainly for political reasons — to pacify those who believe that gas is bad and that oil and gas proj - ects should simply be stopped. This is not only wrong but also enormously naïve. One of the best ways to reduce CO2 for the next few decades is to use gas to replace coal. When oil and gas prices skyrocketed last winter, nations around the world — wealthy and very climate-conscious nations like France, Germany and the Netherlands, as well as lower-income nations like Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam that could not afford the higher cost — started to turn back to their coal plants. This high- lights the importance of safe, secure and affordable energy. Second, the export of LNG is a great eco- nomic boon for the United States. But most import- ant is the realpolitik goal: Our allied nations that need secure and affordable energy resources, including critical nations like Japan, Korea and most of our European allies, would like to be able to depend on the United States for energy. This now puts them in a difficult position — they may have to look elsewhere for such supplies, turning to Iran, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates or maybe even Russia. We need to minimize anything that can tear at our economic bonds with our allies. The strength of our domestic production of energy gives us a “power advantage” — cheaper and more reliable energy, which creates economic and geo - political advantages. Industrial policy is now necessary, but it should be carefully constructed and limited. In some cases, industrial policy (using government resources to subsidize investments to help make businesses more competitive) may be the only solution for quickly building up the industries we need (rare earths and semiconductors, among others) to guarantee resilient national security. The IRA and CHIPS Act are good examples of this and government has to get it right. Such policy can also be used to help combat unfair competitive policies of nations that are using state capitalism and state control to dominate critical industries. However, when crafting industrial policy, the function of government needs to be narrowly defined and kept simple; i.e., governmental jurisdic- tion should be limited to very specific products and 48 A PIVOTAL MOMENT FOR AMERICA AND THE FREE WESTERN WORLD: STRATEGY AND POLICY MATTER probably to what we know works, such as tax cred- its and, to a lesser extent, loan guarantees. And industrial policy should include twin provisions: 1) strict limitations on political interference, like social policies, and 2) specific permitting require- ments, which, if not drastically improved, will badly inhibit our ability to make investments and allow infrastructure to be built. Adding social policy, poli- tics and matters other than simple tax credits dra- matically reduces the economic efficiency of indus- trial policy and creates conditions for corporate America to feed at the trough of government largess. We should quickly address how we can improve on already executed legislation. We do not want to look back and have great regrets about how so much of this policy work failed. There are those who argue that the U.S. govern - ment needs much more far-reaching industrial policy to be able to micromanage and accomplish its many ambitious objectives. To those I say, read further in this section about how ineffective so many government policies have been. We should be tough, but we should engage with China. Over the last 20 years, China has been executing a more comprehensive economic strategy than we have. The country’s leaders have successfully grown their nation and, depending on how you measure it, have the first or second largest econ - omy in the world. That said, many question the current economic focus of China’s leadership as they don’t have everything figured out. While China has become the largest trading partner to many countries around the world, its own GDP per person is $13,000. And the country continues to be beset by many economic and domestic issues. China has its own national security concerns. The country is located in a very politically complex part of the world, and many of China’s actions have caused its neighbors (e.g., Japan, Korea, Philippines, among others) to start to re-arm and, in fact, draw closer to the United States. It also surprises many Americans to hear that while our country is 100% energy sufficient, China needs to import 10 million barrels of oil a day. It is clear that China’s new lead- ership has set a different course, with a much more intense focus on national security, military capabil- ity and internal development. That is their right, and we simply need to adjust to it. America still has an enormously strong hand — plenty of food, water and energy; peaceful neigh - bors; and what remains the most prosperous and dynamic economy the world has ever seen, with a per person GDP of over $80,000 a year. Most important, our nation is blessed with the benefit of true freedom and liberty. See the sidebar on the amazing power of freedom later in this section. While we may always have a complex relationship with China (made all the more complicated and serious by ongoing wars), the country’s vast size and importance to so many other nations requires us to stay engaged — thoughtfully and without fear. At the same time, we need to build and exe- cute our own long-term, comprehensive economic security strategy to keep our position safe and secure. I believe that respectful, strong and consis - tent engagement would be best for both our coun - tries and the rest of the world. We need to strengthen and rebuild the international order — we may need a new Bretton Woods. The international rules-based order established by the Western world after World War II is clearly under attack by outside forces, somewhat weak - ened by its own failures and inability to keep up with the increasingly complex world. This interna - tional order relies on a web of military alliances, trade agreements (e.g., World Trade Organization), development finance (e.g., International Monetary Fund and the World Bank) and related global tax and investment policies and diplomacy organiza - tions (e.g., United Nations), which have evolved into a confusing and overlapping regime of poli- cies. You can now add to it the new issues of cyber warfare, digital trade and privacy, and global taxes, among others. 49 A PIVOTAL MOMENT FOR AMERICA AND THE FREE WESTERN WORLD: STRATEGY AND POLICY MATTER It might be a good idea to convene a group of like- minded leaders to build and improve upon what already exists. The time may be right for a reimag - ined Bretton Woods — and by this, I mean revitaliz - ing our global architecture. Since too many parts of the world have been neglected, any new system has to take into account and properly address the needs of all nations, including areas of concen - trated poverty. While we hope the wars in Ukraine and in the Middle East will end eventually (and, we hope, suc- cessfully from the standpoint of our allies), these other critical economic battles could possibly con - tinue throughout our lifetime. If the Western world is slowly split apart over the next few decades, it will likely be the result of our failure to effectively address crucial global economic challenges. PROVIDING STRONG LEADERSHIP GLOBALLY AND EFFECTIVE POLICYMAKING DOMESTICALLY When you travel around the United States and talk with people of all types and persuasions, there is a rather common refrain; namely, why are we help - ing foreign nations with the safety of their borders and economies when we are not doing a particu - larly good job of protecting our own? While there is no moral equivalency in these arguments, they are understandable. It is clear that many Americans feel we need to do a better job here at home before we can focus over there. We can under- stand why some people living in this country, who have been neglected for decades, ask how their government can find the money for Ukraine and other parts of the world but not for them. It is a reasonable question. From my point of view, our highly charged, emo- tional and political domestic issues are centered around 1) immigration and lack of border security and 2) the fraying of the American dream, particu - larly for low-income and rural Americans who feel left behind amid the growing wealth and prosper - ity of others around them. Please read the sidebar on page 57, which I believe explains the legitimate frustration of some of our citizens. And I agree with them. In the sidebar, I also explain how two policies (a large expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit and focus on work skills and job outcomes at high schools, community colleges and colleges) would not only dramatically increase both the income and employment opportunities for many of those left behind but would also have the virtue of actu - ally growing the workforce. The combined effect of all of this would be quite a boon to our GDP. I believe that many affected Americans are not angry at hardworking, law-abiding immigrants and, in fact, acknowledge the critical role immi - grants continue to play in building this wonderful country. Rather, they are angry that America has not implemented proper border control and immi - gration policies. It is astounding that many in Congress know what to do and want to do it but are simply unable to pass legislation because of partisan politics. Congress did come close on a few occasions — and I hope they keep trying. Deliberate policies meant to drive healthy growth are needed. For over two decades, since 2000, America has grown at an anemic rate of 2%. We should have strived for and achieved 3% growth. Had we done so, GDP per person today would be $16,000 higher, which would, in turn, have paid for better healthcare, childcare, education and other services. Importantly, the best way to handle our excess deficit and debt issues is to maximize economic growth. Growth policies include (the list could be very long so I’ll just mention a few): • Consistent tax policies, conducive to both employment and capital investment. Capital investment is the primary driver of innovation, productivity and, therefore, growth in America. Tax policies change too frequently, which causes uncertainty and complicates long-term capital investment decision making (I won’t bore you with the details here). A bipartisan committee of Congress is probably required to fix this — and the sooner the better. 50 A PIVOTAL MOMENT FOR AMERICA AND THE FREE WESTERN WORLD: STRATEGY AND POLICY MATTER • Well-conceived regulations (and related laws). This requires an ongoing concerted effort to streamline regulations to cost effec - tively drive better outcomes for the United States. The last thing we need is a constant pile-on of politically driven, fragmented poli - cies. Please read the sidebar on the next page, an editorial in The Wall Street Journal by George McGovern, one of the most liberal presidential nominees in our lifetime, in which he clearly lays out the complexity, risks and costs that businesses, large and small, face every day. While he acknowledges the worthi - ness of the goals of many regulations, he points out their negatives. He also calls out the “blame-shifting and scapegoating” and “the endless exposure to frivolous claims and high legal fees.” Not only is this state of affairs demoralizing, but it also reduces employment, capital investment and the for - mation of new businesses, as well as cause unnecessary bankruptcies. Estimates of the regulatory costs for America are approxi - mately $19,000 per worker, dwarfing the reg - ulatory burdens in other countries. We all want sensible regulations that make us a bet - ter and safer nation — but this number is astounding. We should be able to accomplish our goals while sharply reducing needless and wasteful expenses. And remember, it’s dis- couraging not only to companies but to all cit - izens who have to deal with it on a daily basis. • Timely permits on projects large and small. There is virtually no industry — from agricul - ture and construction to transportation, tech - nology, and oil and gas — or business, large or small, that isn’t disadvantaged by the tedious process and the length of time it takes to get approvals for permits to get things done. This includes federal, state and local requirements. These bottlenecks also make investment far more costly and slow. Timely permits would improve infrastructure and save lives, not endanger them. • Proper federal government budgeting and fiscal management. The staggering inability of the government to draft and pass a proper budget causes deep and unnecessary damage to our growth. Some people estimate that the waste alone (due to improper payments, over - lapping programs, and fragmented and duplica - tive contracts, among other things) could cost the nation hundreds of billions of dollars annu - ally. This uncertainty filters through virtually every part of the American economy and should not be accepted. We can all forgo a little self-interest to do what is right for our country. Those of us who have benefited the most from this country bear even greater responsibility to do this. It’s perfectly understandable that institutions, including businesses, unions and industries, lobby in Washington, D.C., to protect themselves — in good ways and bad — but we should more regu - larly put national interests ahead of self-interests. It’s good to want to ensure well-paying jobs and healthy industries. But it is not good when it reduces competition, stops the deployment of enhanced technology, harms efficiency, creates fake jobs or builds bridges to nowhere or damages the general health of the economy. Doing the right thing, the right way — which is achievable — would be better for everyone. As former President John F. Kennedy said, “Ask not what your country can do for you — ask what you can do for your country.” Celebrate American exceptionalism. We can safely say that America is an exceptional nation built and grounded on principles — princi - ples of freedom of speech, freedom of religion, free enterprise (capitalism), and the freedom and empowerment brought to us by our democracy through the power to elect our leaders and of our Constitution, which makes these individual free - doms sacrosanct. Much of the world yearns to be here because of those principles — the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. We should extol those virtues while recognizing that America has never been a perfect nation, like all other nations. We can acknowledge our flaws and strive to constantly correct them, without denigrating our nation. 51 A PIVOTAL MOMENT FOR AMERICA AND THE FREE WESTERN WORLD: STRATEGY AND POLICY MATTER THE WALL STREET JOURNAL. JUN E 01, 1992 (Copyright O /992 , Dow Jones & Co., Inc.) Manager's ] oumal: A Politician's Dream ls a Businessman's Nightmare By George McGovern Wisdom too often never comes, and so one ought not to reject it merely because it comes late. -- Justice Felix Frankfurter It's been 11 years since I left the U.S. Senate, after serving 24 years in high public office. After leaving a career in politics, I devoted much of my time to public lectures that took me into every state in the union and much of Europe, Asia, the Middle East and Latin America. In 1988, I invested most of the earnings from this lecture circuit acquiring the leasehold on Connecticut's Stratford Inn . Hotels, inns and restaurants have always held a special fascination for me. The Stratford Inn promised the realization of a longtime dream to own a combination hotel, restaurant and public conference facility -- complete with an experienced manager and staff. In retrospect, I wish I had known more about the hazards and difficulties of such a business, especially during a recession of the kind that hit New England just as I was acquiring the inn's 43-year leasehold. I also wish that during the years I was in public office, I had had this firsthand experience about the difficulties business people face every day. That knowledge would have made me a better U.S. senator and a more understanding presidential contender. Today we are much closer to a general acknowledgment that government must encourage business to expand and grow. Bill Clinton, Paul Tsongas, Bob Kerrey and others have, I believe, changed the debate of our party. We intuitively know that to create job opportunities we need entrepreneurs who will risk their capital against an expected payoff. Too often, however, public policy does not consider whether we are choking off those opportunities. My own business perspective has been limited to that small hotel and restaurant in Stratford, Conn., with an especially difficult lease and a severe recession. But my business associates and I also lived with federal, state and local rules that were all passed with the objective of helping employees, protecting the environment, raising tax dollars for schools, protecting our customers from fire hazards, etc. While I never have doubted the worthiness of any of these goals, the concept that most often eludes legislators is: \"Can we make consumers pay the higher prices for the increased operating costs that accompany public regnlation and government reporting requirements with reams of red tape.\" It is a simple concern that is nonetheless often ignored by legislators. For example, the papers today are filled with stories about businesses dropping health coverage for employees. We provided a substantial package for our staff at the Stratford Inn. However, were we operating today, those costs would exceed $150,000 a year for health care on top of salaries and other benefits. There would have been no reasonable way for us to absorb or pass on these costs. Some of the escalation in the cost of health care is attributed to patients suing doctors. While one cannot assess the merit of all these claims, I've also witnessed firsthand the explosion in blame -shifting and scapegoating for every negative experience in life. Today, despite bankruptcy, we are still dealing with litigation from individuals who fell in or near our restaurant. Despite these injuries, not cause. But that reason masks the variety of other challenges we faced that drive operating costs and financing charges beyond what a small business can handle. It is clear that some businesses have products that can be priced at almost any level. The price of raw materials (e.g., steel and glass) and life-saving drugs and medical care are not easily substituted by consumers. It is only competition or antitrust that tempers price increases. Consumers may delay purchases, but they have little choice when faced with higher prices. In services, however, consumers do have a choice when faced with higher prices. You may have to stay in a hotel while on vacation, but you can stay fewer days. You can eat in restaurants fewer times per month, or forgo a number of services from car washes to shoeshines. Every such decision eventually results in job losses for someone. And often these are the people without the skills to help themselves -· the people I've spent a lifetime trying to help. In short, \"one-size-fits-all\" rules for business ignore the reality of the marketplace. And setting thresholds for regulatory guidelines at artificial levels -- e.g., 50 employees or more, $500,000 in sales -- takes no account of other realities, such as profit margins, labor intensive vs. capital intensive businesses, and local market economics. The problem we face as legislators is: Where do we set the bar so that it is not too high to clear? I don't have the answer. I do know that we every misstep is the fault of someone need to start raising these questions else. Not every such incident should be more often. viewed as a lawsuit instead of an unfortunate accident. And while the business owner may prevail in the end, the endless exposure to frivolous claims and high legal fees is frightening. Our Connecticut hotel, along with many others, went bankrupt for a variety of reasons, the general economy in the Northeast being a significant Mr. McGovern, the 1972 Democratic presidential candidate, is president of the Middle-Eastern Policy Council in Washington.

Do NOT EDIT OR ALTER REl'IIIHTS. llffllOOUC'/10NS Nr1T ,ERtmED [) I DOW JONES Let’s celebrate the shared sense of sacrifice that gives us all strength. There were very few positives from the pandemic, but I’m mentioning one, which, unfortunately, didn’t last, but reflected the best of us. In New York City, at 7 p.m. every evening, people through - out the city would open their windows, shouting and screaming and banging pots and pans to show gratitude to the essential workers — sanitation workers, police, firefighters, emergency respond - ers, nurses and doctors. Of course, these workers were always essential, but I was hoping that spirit and civility would become deeply embedded and have longer lasting effects in our society. I can understand when an individual for conscien - tious reasons chooses not to do work that helps our military. But I cannot understand when an entire company takes that position. How can we have a sense of shared sacrifice, when America is home to 18 million veterans who were willing to risk their lives for America’s safety, and yet some companies are not even willing to use their finger- tips to help? For example, back in 1969 the cancellation of the Reserve Officers’ Training Corps programs by the country’s most prestigious universities and colleges likely fueled the great divide — between elites and others in our country — that persists today. Our strength as a nation is best served when the best students and the best soldiers are brought together, and we would all benefit from more civility and better teaching around basic virtues like hard work, shared sacrifice, justice, rationality and more respect for the enduring values of American freedom and free enterprise. Resist being “weaponized.” We can start by trying to understand other people’s and other voters’ points of view, even around deeply emotional topics. We can stop insulting whole classes of voters. We can stop name calling. We can stop blame-shifting and scapegoating. We can stop being petty. Politicians can cease insulting, baiting and belittling each other, which diminishes them and the voter. It has also become too acceptable for some politicians to say one thing in private and deliver a completely different message in public. It would also be nice to see some cabinet members from the opposing party. We should also stop degrading and demonizing American business and American institutions, which are the best in the world, because it erodes confidence in our very country. Social media could do more. There is no question that social media has some real negative effects, from the manipulation of elections to the increasingly documented negative effects on the mental health of children. These are issues impacting our individual and collective spheres, and it’s time for social media companies to take more action to remedy these challenges — and swiftly. Rapid advances in technology will not only make these existing issues harder to address, but they will likely create new ones. The current state of the online information landscape has wide-ranging implications on trust in institutions, information integrity and more — and it bears on institutions like ours, where platform policy has increasingly widespread implications for concerns about fraud, security and other issue spaces. A range of tools and approaches is required to address this complex and important situation — and there are several measures that platform com - panies can immediately enact, voluntarily, while strengthening and improving their business models. One commonsense and modest step would be for social media companies to further empower plat - form users’ control over what they see and how it is presented, leveraging existing tools and features — like the alternative feed algorithm settings some offer today. I believe many users (not just parents) would appreciate a greater ability to more care - fully curate their feeds; for example, prioritizing educational content for their children. Platforms could also consider enhanced authenti - cation measures; i.e., having users identify them - selves to the platform or to a trusted third party. This would have the virtue of increasing individual accountability and reducing imposters, bots and 53 A PIVOTAL MOMENT FOR AMERICA AND THE FREE WESTERN WORLD: STRATEGY AND POLICY MATTER possibly foreign political actors on platforms. It would have immediate benefits for users who pre - fer content from authenticated sources that take responsibility for their postings. There are clear competing values that need to be balanced in such an approach, including those related to our cher- ished right to free speech, individual privacy and inclusion (for example, roughly 850 million people globally don’t have a way to easily authenticate themselves today). There are also legitimate ques- tions as to whether authentication would be used as a tool to chill or block speech or quash bona fide political dissenters, and real work needs to be done to identify policy and technical solutions that balance such risks and benefits. I offer these approaches as a starting place, under - standing that it’s crucial to continue honest con- versation across sectors about the immediate, incremental improvements we can make to our online public square, considering the high stakes involved in how information is created and shared. Effective measures will require time, money, learn - ing and improvement, all in service of significantly enhancing the well-being, quality, and civility of our experiences online and in the world around us. Healthy collaboration with business is needed. Companies big and small create jobs, pay for employee healthcare and benefits, and build bridges, roads and hospitals. The people who work for and run these companies care deeply about their country — they are patriots, and they want to see people and communities succeed and prosper. Unfortunately, the message America hears is that the federal government does not value business — that business is the problem and not part of the solution. There are fewer individuals in govern - ment who have any significant experience in start - ing or running a company, which is apparent every day in the political rhetoric that demonizes busi - nesses and free enterprise and that damages con - fidence in American’s institutions. The relationship between business and government, in fact, might improve if there were more people from the busi - ness sector working in government. Inexperience with business is also evident from the regular lack of transparency or curiosity from regulators as they develop economic policies with potentially seismic consequences for the economy. When I travel around the country, I experience a very different perspective on the street and at the local level — I see that many governors, mayors and city council members understand they are not facing big challenges alone. They stand shoulder to shoulder with our company, even when some of their constituents disagree or are skeptical about big banks. These government officials know they need partners who have the same stake in helping successful communities thrive and who care about building a prosperous future as much as they do. For example, in fewer than 10 years, Detroit saw one of the greatest turnarounds because of a vibrant collaboration between government and business. And businesses know they cannot suc - ceed if individuals, families, towns and cities are not flourishing. We obviously don’t agree on every- thing, but there is a shared belief that we must work together. We can and should be full partners in developing solutions to our big problems. The federal government, regardless of which party is in charge, needs to earn back trust through competence and effective policymaking. The world is becoming more complex, more tech - nologically competent and faster. Unfortunately, the government simply is not built to innovate, compete and move quickly, as in the competitive business world. This may be the reason why gov - ernment is becoming less effective. We need to take action on this because the loss of trust in government is damaging to society. We should be brutally honest about the staggering number of policies, systems and operations that are under - performing: Too many ineffective public schools do not give students the skills they need to land a well-paying job; we have over 25 million uninsured Americans, soaring healthcare costs and too many bad outcomes; we are unable to plan, permit and build infrastructure efficiently; our litigation 54 A PIVOTAL MOMENT FOR AMERICA AND THE FREE WESTERN WORLD: STRATEGY AND POLICY MATTER system is capricious and wasteful; progress on immigration policies and reform is frustrating; lack of efficient mortgage markets and an affordable housing policy keep housing out of reach for many Americans; problems plague the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Federal Aviation Administra- tion and the Internal Revenue Service; public uni - versities don’t take responsibility for their costs and are often funded by excessive student lending; underinvestment in the electric grid results in high costs and unreliable service; highly inefficient U.S. merchant shipping and ports; and we have unfunded pension plans and no action on deficit spending, Social Security and Medicare. I’ll stop here. This should be unacceptable to all of us. We need to find a way to bring more varied expertise and accountability to government. We should be more ambitious in striving for excel- lence in government. I acknowledge that some of the best and the brightest are in government and the military today. Yet we should return to a govern- ment that seeks out more of the best and the brightest people from every background, including the private sector, to benefit from their knowledge and experience. Government also needs to leverage the expertise of business to address problems that it cannot solve on its own. And to be fair, business could use its influence to do less to further its own interest and more to enhance the nation as a whole. We need good government. And there are some things only governments can do, such as oversee the military and justice systems. And while most innovation happens through the private sector, there are certain types of foundational innovations that can only be advanced by the government, such as basic research that simply cannot be funded by business. The Democrats want the government to do even more and the Republicans even less — I think we should spend more time trying to do even better. But no one, not even my most liberal Democratic friends, thinks that send - ing the government another trillion a year would be a wise use of money. OUT OF THE LABYRINTH, WITH FOCUS AND RESOLVE Even America, the most prosperous nation on the planet with its vast resources, needs to focus its resources on the complex and difficult tasks ahead. I hope to never read a book about How the West Was Lost, summarized as follows: The failure to save Ukraine and find peace in the Middle East led to more bickering among the allies and weakened military alliances. This accelerated a division within the Western world, splitting countries into different economic spheres and with each nation trying to protect its economy, trade and energy sources. America’s economy weakened, eventually leading to the loss of its reserve currency status. Besotted by populism and partisanship and crippled by bureaucracy and lack of willpower, America failed to focus on what it needed to do to lead and save the Western world. The enemy was within — we just didn’t see it in time. Paraphrasing what Winston Churchill was thought to have said: America, after it had exhausted all other possibilities, would do the right thing. What I want and hope to see is a book about How the West Was Won. As the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East dragged on and as the fears of the Western world mounted, America rose to the challenge as it had in other turbulent times in history. America coalesced with its allies to form the alliances necessary to keep the world safe for freedom and democracy. I remain with a deep and abiding faith in the strength of the enduring values of America. 55 A PIVOTAL MOMENT FOR AMERICA AND THE FREE WESTERN WORLD: STRATEGY AND POLICY MATTER WE SHOULD HAVE MORE FAITH IN THE AMAZING POWER OF OUR FREEDOMS The heart and soul of the dynamism of America is human freedom — freedom of speech, freedom of religion, free enterprise (capitalism), and the freedom and empowerment brought to us by our democracy through the right to elect our leaders. Free people are at liberty to move around as they see fit, work as they see fit, dream as they see fit, and invest in themselves and in the pursuit of happiness as they see fit. This freedom that people enjoy, accompanied by the freedom of capital, is what drives the dynamism — economic and social — of this great country. Our civil liberties depend upon the rule of law, property rights, including intellectual property, and restrictions on government encroachment upon these freedoms. Our Constitution and Bill of Rights secure our individual freedoms and reserve all rights to the individual other than those important but limited authorities given to the government. The issue of individual rights is not all or none or freedom ver - sus no freedom. There are, of course, terrible examples where individual rights were trampled upon, and the results were dev - astating — both for the individual and for the economy — in East Germany, Iran, North Korea, Russia, Venezuela, to name a few. And there are many countries that protect individual rights and are on a spectrum closer to American values. Think of Europe, for example. But even in some countries that have some of these rights, a lack of dynamism — often due to bureaucracy, weak institutions and government, and corruption — is palpable and has clearly led to less innovation, lower growth and, in general, a lower standard of living. Freedom must necessarily be joined with the principle of striving toward equal opportunity. Equal opportunity is what allows individuals to rise to the best of their ability — it also means unequal outcomes. Equal opportunity is the foundation for fairness and meritocracy. The fight for equality, which is a good moral goal, should not damage the rights of the individual and their liberties. Democracy and freedom are cojoined — together, they make freedom more durable. Democracy also has a self-correcting element — every four years you get to throw out leadership if you don’t like them (which you do not see in autocracies). But we all know that democracy can be sloppy: Maintaining an effective democracy is hard work. Democracy fosters open debate and compromise, which lead to better decisions over time (whether in government or in business). Intelligence is effectively “crowdsourced” with constant feedback. Good public policy comes from good debate and analytics, guided by reason coupled with a firm understanding of what you would like the outcomes to be and complemented with an honest assessment of what is really happening. Even democracies can become stagnant, bureaucratic and self- perpetuating. Good government does many admirable things, but admitting to mistakes is often not one of them. It takes civically engaged citizens and a strong free press to bring sunlight to issues and keep a nation strong. Autocratic societies by their nature subjugate the individual to the state. By definition they are not meritocracies — they are more about “who you know,” and they exist to perpetuate the existing ruling class. Their decisions are based on a completely different calculation, and their decision-making process does not encourage and, therefore, benefit from open debate. Democracy means that it is immoral to subjugate individual freedoms to state actors other than to protect the existence of the nation itself. There are values that many of us hold dear, such as religion, family and country. But none may be more important than the freedoms that allow us to choose to live our life as we see fit. We should do more to applaud the virtue and amazing power of our freedoms. 56 A PIVOTAL MOMENT FOR AMERICA AND THE FREE WESTERN WORLD: STRATEGY AND POLICY MATTER HOW WE CAN HELP LIFT UP OUR LOW-INCOME CITIZENS AND MEND AMERICA’S TORN SOCIAL FABRIC To fix problems, we must first acknowledge them. Despite decades of government programs and all the moralizing that surrounds them, we have not done a particularly good job lifting up our low-income fellow citizens. I may be wrong, but I do believe this is tearing at the social fabric of America and is among the root causes of the fraying of the American dream. The gap between low-wage and well-paid workers has been growing dramatically. From 1979 to 2019, the wage growth of the top 10% was nearly 10 times that of the bottom 10% — which, basically, had not increased at all. The growth of low- income workers’ annualized real wages after the pandemic was, for the first time in decades, higher than the top 60%, but that’s not enough. The net worth for the bottom 25% of households is $20,800, and the net worth for the bottom 10% is essentially $0. This makes it increasingly difficult for low- wage workers to support their families. Of the 160 million Americans working today, approximately 40 million are paid less than $15 per hour. Low-income individuals bear far greater burdens than the rest of us. Nearly 40% of Americans don’t have $400 in savings to deal with unexpected expenses, such as medical bills or car repairs, which leads to financial distress. More than 25 million Americans don’t have medical insurance at all; of these, one in five are in a family with income below the federal poverty level. People who live in low-income neighborhoods also tend to have worse health outcomes, including higher rates of mental health issues, depression and suicide, and a lower life expectancy — as many as 20 years. Finally, low-income Americans generally experience higher unemployment and more crime. No one can claim that the promise of equal opportunity is being offered to all Americans through our education systems. Students in the lowest socioeconomic bracket are 50% less likely to attend college than those in the highest socioeconomic groups. Many inner city schools graduate under 50% of their students — and even those who graduate may not be well- prepared for the workforce. In addition, boys growing up in the bottom 10% of family income are 20 times more likely to be incarcerated. Those who do run afoul of our justice system generally do not get the second chance that many of them deserve. Their exclusion from the workforce is not only unfair to them but also results in an estimated $87 billion average annual cost to the economy. Too many policies that are wrong — affecting housing and mortgage markets, healthcare, immigration, regulation, education and student lending, to name a few — are jeopardizing the opportunity for American citizens to succeed. The people who suffer the most, throughout all of this, are not high-income individuals. I strongly believe that these outcomes are destroying the concept of “fair” in America and are driving populism and diminishing, if not eliminating, trust — not only in government but in all our institutions. Simply put, the social needs of far too many of our citizens are not being met. We should never accept these outcomes — we must fix them. There are two policy changes that I believe can have a dramatic effect on jobs, growth and equality — and they go a long way toward repairing the frayed American dream. Let’s start by treating all jobs with respect. Even starter jobs, which are the first rung on the ladder of opportunity, bring dignity and create better social outcomes in terms of health, higher household formation and lower crime. Of these two policy changes, one would better utilize existing resources, and the other would cost some money. But both would significantly change outcomes for low-income Americans. The free one is so blindingly obvious that it’s almost embarrassing to propose. Our schools (high schools, community colleges and perhaps even four-year colleges) should take responsibility for outcomes — they should be judged on the quality and income level of the jobs that their graduates and even non-graduates attain. This means providing graduating students and other individuals with work skills (in fields such as advanced manufacturing, cyber, data science and technology, healthcare and so on) that will lead to better paying jobs. These schools should work with local businesses to replicate effective programs that are in place — because that is where the actual jobs are now. This would be good for growth and, as there are so many examples of successful programs, we 57 A PIVOTAL MOMENT FOR AMERICA AND THE FREE WESTERN WORLD: STRATEGY AND POLICY MATTER already know what to do. With nearly 9 million job openings and just under 6 million unemployed workers in the United States, job skills training has never been needed more. We already spend a tremendous amount of money on education — just not the right way. The second step is related to the first: Get more income to low- paid workers. While this one would cost money, it is to me a complete no-brainer since it is an expansion of an existing program, the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), which many Democrats and Republicans already agree upon. Today, the EITC supplements low- to moderate-income working individuals and couples, particularly with children and people living in rural areas. For example, a single mother with two children earning $9 an hour (approximately $20,000 a year) could receive a tax credit of more than $6,000 at year-end. Workers without children receive a very small tax credit (96% of all EITC dollars were received by families with children). This should be dramatically expanded, including eliminating the child requirement from the calculation altogether. We should convert the EITC to make it more like a negative income payroll tax, paid monthly. Any tax credit income should not be offset by any other benefits these individuals already receive (we have to eliminate benefit “cliffs” that disincentivize work). An increase in the EITC to a maximum of $10,000 would cost tens of billions a year, but I have little doubt that these policy changes would do more than anything else to lift up low- income families and their communities. Well-paying jobs have been shown to reduce crime, increase household formation, improve health and reduce addiction. Both of these policies would have the virtue of increasing the number of people in the workforce. I also have little doubt that this would add to GDP. We should attack all our other problems as well, but these two policy changes alone would dramatically improve our low- income neighborhoods, broadly strengthen the economy and give more opportunity to deserving citizens. It would restore the American Dream for many. 58 A PIVOTAL MOMENT FOR AMERICA AND THE FREE WESTERN WORLD: STRATEGY AND POLICY MATTER In Closing It’s been 20 years since the Bank One-JPMorgan Chase merger — and it’s been an extraordinary journey. I can’t even begin to express my heartfelt appreciation and respect for the tremendous character and capabilities of the management team who got us through the good times and the bad times to where we stand today. And I recognize that we all stand on the shoulders of many others who came before us in building this exceptional company of ours. I would also like to express my deep gratitude to the 300,000+ employees, and their families, of JPMorgan Chase. Through these annual letters, I hope shareholders and all readers have gained a deeper understanding of what it takes to be an “endgame winner” in a rapidly changing world. More important, I hope you are as proud of what we have achieved — as a business, as a bank and as a community investor — as I am. Thank you for your partnership. Finally, we sincerely hope to see the world on the path to peace and prosperity.

Quartile rankings are based on the net-of-fee absolute return of each fund. Where applicable, the fund rating providers redenominate asset values into U.S. dollars. The percentage of AUM is based on fund performance and associated peer rankings at the share class level for U.S.-domiciled funds, at a “primary share class” level to represent the quartile ranking for U.K., Luxembourg and Hong Kong SAR funds and at the fund level for all other funds. The performance data may have been different if all share classes had been included. Past performance is not indicative of future results. “Primary share class” means the C share class for European funds and Acc share class for Hong Kong SAR and Taiwan funds.

A 5-star rating is the best rating and represents the top 10% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 4-star rating represen ts the next 22.5% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 3-star rating represents the next 35% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 2-star rating represents the next 22.5% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 1-star rating is the worst rating and represents the bottom 10% of industrywide ranked funds. An overall Morningstar rating is derived from a weighted average of the performance associated with a fund’s three-, five and ten- year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. For U.S.- domiciled funds, separate star ratings are provided at the individual share class level. The Nomura “star rating” is based on three-year risk-adjusted performance only. Funds with fewer than three years of history are not rated and hence excluded from these rankings. All ratings, the assigned peer categories and the asset values used to derive these rankings are sourced from the applicable fund rating provider. Where applicable, the fund rating providers redenominate asset values into U.S. dollars.

Our strategy is working as evidenced by our results last year. GROWING AND DEEPENING RELATIONSHIPS After the pandemic, we accelerated the pace of customer acquisition while lower- ing attrition. Maintaining that momentum, we now serve over 82 million consumers and 6.4 million small businesses, up 11% and 37%, respectively, since 2019. We’re driving that growth across businesses — during the same period, Consumer Bank - ing customers are up 18%, Business Banking clients are up 41% and Card accounts are up 30% 1. We’re engaging customers with our prod- ucts and services and delivering seamless experiences across digital and branch channels. Our digital banking platform grew to nearly 67 million active custom- ers, up 28% since 2019. Once customers begin to use Chase.com and the Chase mobile app, we make it easy to help them save for the future, make small or big purchases (including a car or home), plan for retirement or a dream vacation, or find the perfect restaurant for a night on the town. Our branches remain a critical touchpoint as over 900,000 people walk into one every day. We know being local matters and that customers increasingly value personal interaction and advice. In 2023, over 2 million more customers met with a banker than in 2022. Once we onboard a customer to the fran - chise, we focus on earning the right to deepen that relationship and serve more of their financial needs. Last year was a banner year for deepening as we ended 2023 with over 24 million multi-line of business (LOB) customers — up 9% from 2022 and 30% from 2019 3. We have prioritized growing multi-LOB relation - ships as it helps us address more of our customers’ needs while driving higher retention and engagement with our prod - ucts and services. We constantly focus on improving the customer experience, which we measure in many ways. We’re proud to have all-time-high satisfaction I’m very proud to have co-led Consumer & Community Banking (CCB) for the past three years and am grateful to Jenn Piepszak for her partnership. When we took over this leading franchise, we established a strategic framework for continued, long-term success, and that framework guided CCB to deliver strong performance again in 2023. The evolving macro landscape means uncertainty on many fronts: the financial health of the consumer, the path of credit and interest rates, and the impact of new regulations. While the future will bring challenges, it will also create opportunities, and we’ve proved our ability to adapt and optimize. In 2023, we remained focused on a consistent set of strategic priorities: • Growing and deepening relationships by: — Engaging customers with products and services they love and — Expanding our distribution Consumer & Community Banking CCB 0405_v3 Charts 4/3/24 1 Defined as average sales debit active accounts. 2 Unique families with primary and joint account owners for open and funded accounts. 3 Reflects consumers and small businesses that have relationships with two or more CCB lines of business. 2023 2022 2021 2020 2019 2023 2022 2021 2020 2019 2023 2022 2021 2020 2019 +30% +21% -67% 2023 2022 2021 2020 20192023 2022 2021 2020 2019 2023 2022 2021 2020 2019 +18% +41% +60% 2019 TO 2023 GROWTH CONSUMER BANKING CUSTOMERS CREDIT CARD ACTIVE ACCOUNTS 1 BUSINESS BANKING CLIENTS AUTO LOAN AND LEASE ORIGINATIONS WEALTH MANAGEMENT RELATIONSHIPS2 HOME LENDING MORTGAGE ORIGINATIONS CONSUMER & COMMUNITY BANKING 63 ratings across branch and digital chan - nels, while our complaint rate per account is down nearly 10% year-over- year. Customer attrition is below historic levels, and CCB’s overall net promoter score remains very healthy. DELIVERING FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE THAT IS CONSISTENTLY BEST-IN-CLASS While we recognize that favorable macro conditions contributed to overearning in net interest income and credit, we still out- performed as we delivered strong returns and grew market share across businesses. With a 38% return on equity, we exceeded our 25% target for the third straight year and would have done so even when nor- malized to reflect through-the-cycle credit and rate assumptions. Net income was $21.2 billion, up 42% over 2022. Revenue of $70.1 billion was up 28% from 2022, and CCB’s overhead ratio was 50%. Average deposits were $1.1 trillion, and although down 3% from 2022, we outperformed the industry average. Average loans were up 20% over the prior year to $526 billion, including the First Republic acquisition. EXTENDING OUR #1 POSITION ACROSS INDUSTRY-LEADING BUSINESSES Our momentum is driven by successful execution across all lines of business in CCB. We’re the clear market leader in Consumer Banking, Business Banking and Card and continue to grow. Consumer Banking We extended our #1 position in 2023 with an 11.3% deposit market share, up 40 basis points from 2022. Excluding First Republic, share growth was up 10 basis points. Since 2019, we’ve increased our share by 220 basis points. We’ll continue to drive growth by expanding branches and evolving products to meet customer needs by segment. Branches remain the hub for our local team of experts — over 50,000 bankers, advisors and business relationship managers — and a key distribution channel for all parts of the firm. We continue to optimize our network of over 4,800 branches as we aim to be within a 10-minute drive for 70% of the U.S. population. This will help us grow share in major metropolitan areas like Boston, Philadelphia and Washington, D.C., as well as states with mostly rural popula - tions such as Alabama and Iowa, where we are also expanding our presence. We’ve added more than 650 new branches in the last five years, by far the most of any bank in the U.S. We’re doubling down on that investment and will add 500+ branches over the next three years. The result is a significantly younger branch network, which creates embedded growth that already has driven share gains and will continue to do so for years to come. Newer or “unseasoned” branches represent more than $150 bil - lion in incremental deposit upside as they mature. At the same time, we are consoli- dating older branches in certain markets in response to shifting customer behavior. We aim to be the bank for all, so tailoring products, services and experiences for each customer segment and community is central to our strategy. We’re increasingly focused on supporting the financial health of customers and communities through digital and in-person resources, such as our nearly 150 dedicated Community Managers. We now have 16 Community Center branches and plan to open three more in 2024. We started 2023 with a goal of maintain - ing primary bank relationships and cap - turing money in motion, and we did both. We retained over 95% of our primary bank customers and succeeded in deep - ening with investments and an enhanced, higher-yield product set — including competitive-rate CDs and the new J.P. Morgan Premium Deposit account. As a result, we successfully captured more than 80% of yield-seeking flows in 2023. Business Banking We offer small business owners a compre- hensive product suite to help them start, run and grow their businesses. We’re #1 in small business primary bank share with 9.5% of a fragmented market and plan to grow by: • Increasing banker capacity to better co ver large clients, which drives higher retention, cross-product deepening and client satisfaction. In 2023, we added more than 350 bankers against our target of 1,000 incremental bankers. • Rolling out value-added services like pa yroll, broadening our payment accep- tance suite with new offerings such as invoicing (currently in pilot) and launch- ing Tap-to-Pay, which enables mer- chants to accept card payments on their mobile devices. • Continuing to expand support for small bu siness owners in underserved com - munities through special purpose credit programs, one-on-one mentoring and local events. Card In 2023, we extended our #1 position in credit card, with sales and outstandings market share up approximately 50 and 30 basis points, respectively, compared with 2019 4. We drove growth by leveraging our marketing capabilities to get the right products in the right customers’ hands. In 2023, we invested nearly $7 billion in 4 Card outstandings market share has been revised to reflec t a restatement to the 2022 reported total industry outstandings disclosed by Nilson, which impacted annual share growth in 2023. CONSUMER & COMMUNITY BANKING 64 gross marketing to generate 10 million new credit card accounts and deliver benefits to existing cardholders. The continued demand for our leading products has fueled portfolio growth, enabling us to deliver more value and drive engage - ment with our customer base. In 2023, we focused on enhancing our Card product continuum to effectively serve the unique needs of each customer segment and: • Launched Chase Freedom Rise SM for younger, new-to-credit customers, which has shown strong adoption using our branches as its primary distribution. • Launched DoorDash Rewards Mastercard®, adding a new strategic partner to our co-brand portfolio. • Scaled Ink Business PremierSM, launched in late 2022, to grow share with small businesses. • Continued to enhance the Sapphire value proposition by opening lounges in five airports to date and leveraging the travel, dining and shopping experiences we’re building in Connected Commerce. SCALING GROWTH BUSINESSES In Connected Commerce and Wealth Management, we have the assets to win and outsized opportunity to grow to what we view is our fair share, given the breadth of CCB relationships. These busi - nesses are natural adjacencies to banking and credit card, with scale and distribu - tion that will fuel their growth. Connected Commerce We continue building out a powerful two- sided platform to connect Chase custom - ers with top brands, helping them book travel, discover new dining experiences and save money while shopping. We expect to drive approximately $30 billion in volume and about $2 billion in revenue through the platform in 2025. We’ve nearly doubled volume over two years, driving more than $18 billion in 2023. Going forward, we’re focused on: • Scaling Travel. We are a top 5 consumer leisure travel provider with $10 billion in booked volume last year, up more than 25% from 2022. We’ve just relaunched ChaseTravel.com to help customers dream, discover and book travel, including a new collection of more than 600 of the world’s finest hotels. • Expanding Shopping through Chase Offers. In 2023, we generated more than $8 billion in attributed spend volume, up over 30% from 2022. We’re accelerating growth by launching Chase Media Solutions SM, a new digital media business aimed at merchants that allows them to target and connect with Chase customers. • Innovating payments and lending capabilities. To provide customers with innovative, convenient ways to pay and borrow, last year we began to roll out Pay in 4 SM, which has scaled to more than 20 million customers. We also saw more than 50% year-over-year growth in card-linked installment originations through My Chase Plan®. Wealth Management In 2023, we grew client investment assets by 25% to $800 billion before accounting for the First Republic acquisition. In total, we ended the year with $950 billion in assets, up $450 billion since 2019, as we close in on our goal of reaching $1 trillion in assets under supervision. We now have 2.5 million client relationships — up 60% from 2019 — with a record 120,000 first- time investors in 2023. This momentum stems from the invest- ments we’ve made in products, channels and talent in the last four years since we established J.P. Morgan Wealth Management. In 2023, we: • Added more than 400 total advisors, ending the year with nearly 5,500 on a path to 6,000. • Scaled Wealth Plan, an omnichannel financial planning experience that customers start digitally and can finish with an advisor. Customers have created more than 1 million financial plans since the experience launched in December 2022. 5 #1 most-visited banking portal in the U.S. (Chase.com) based on Similarweb. #1 banking portal in the United States5 #1 in total combined U.S. credit and debit payments volume #1 #1 #1 in U.S. retail deposit market share #1#1 #1 primary bank for U.S. small businesses #1 U.S. credit card issuer based on sales and outstandings #1 4 CONSUMER & COMMUNITY BANKING 65 SECURED LENDING Auto and Home Lending In Auto and Home Lending, our objective is not market share but to be there for cus- tomers during key moments and to create franchise value while continuing to maxi- mize the strength of the firm’s balance sheet, capital and liquidity. Given the cycli- cal nature of both businesses, we manage returns on a through-the-cycle basis. Despite recent market headwinds, Auto and Home Lending delivered a return on equity of 17% and 15%, respectively, aver- aged over the last five years 6. While the acquisition of First Republic’s mortgage portfolio helped bolster Home Lending returns last year, CCB’s mortgage business was key to enabling the transaction. Across both businesses, we continue to leverage data and artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled techniques to enhance and optimize our underwriting and credit decisioning. We also remain committed to increasing homeownership among underserved communities. Our Chase Homebuyer Grant program has scaled to over 15,000 communities since its launch in 2021, and we recently increased the grant amount to $7,500 in select markets. LEVERAGING DATA AND TECHNOLOGY TO DELIVER CUSTOMER VALUE AND DRIVE SPEED TO MARKET Data and technology make everything we do better — our products, channels and experiences. In 2023, CCB spent over $3 billion on technology investments spanning both product development and modernization. A little over half of our annual investment is focused on product development, help - ing ensure we have the best products, services and channels to meet customers’ evolving needs. From paying a bill and checking a balance to replacing a card and disputing a transaction, we’re making processes more seamless, taking friction out of customers’ everyday financial lives. At the same time, customers are increas - ingly engaging with our advice-oriented digital and omnichannel experiences to meet their more complex needs, like buy - ing a home or planning for retirement. Engaged online activity — beyond viewing balances — is up 25% since 2019. The rest of our technology investment is focused on modernization, which is both offensive and defensive. We need to deliver new products and experiences more quickly while executing with resil- iency at massive scale to stay competitive and avoid being disrupted. We’ve made significant progress and are on track to substantially complete data center migra - tion by the end of 2024. We’ve also migrated almost 90% of our data to the public cloud. Looking ahead, we’ll con- tinue to focus on modernizing our core banking infrastructure, which will enable us to launch products faster, improve platform stability and reduce run-the- bank expenses over time. Our data migration efforts help us take full advantage of our extraordinary data assets to deliver personalization at scale and accelerate existing and future AI initia- tives. We’ve been using AI for years and have a strong foundation in place. Initially, we focused on using AI to drive cost reduc- tion and risk avoidance, but we’ve pivoted to focus more on revenue growth. We’ll continue to invest where we will realize the greatest benefit, including: • Optimizing marketing efforts to better tar get profitable prospects. • Identifying unmet customer needs, then ad dressing them in the moment with digital nudges and personalized offers. • Increasing the productivity and effi - ci ency of our sales force through lead management and propensity models. • Predicting in real time the likelihood of fr aud to better protect customers and the firm. • Supporting specialists with AI advance - me nts like call prediction, real-time insights and intelligent routing to drive customer and employee satisfaction. PROTECTING OUR CUSTOMERS AND THE FIRM Risk management is core to our culture and a key competitive advantage, helping us build trust and providing security to customers. We are focused on protecting shareholders, customers and the firm by maintaining our fortress balance sheet, strong controls environment and through- the-cycle decision-making approach. CULTIVATING TALENT The work we do matters to customers, communities and the economy overall. Our goal is always to attract and retain great talent and create a culture where every- one’s voice matters. We help employees build a long-term career at the firm and have a workforce that reflects the commu- nities we serve. Our high-performance culture rewards the hard work, heart and humanity that our more than 140,000 employees deliver every day. All of this leads to the best business outcomes. ACQUIRING FIRST REPUBLIC In the midst of widespread instability in the banking sector, it was the strength and breadth of our franchise and the dedication of thousands of employees that enabled us to complete the acquisi- tion of virtually all of First Republic’s assets in one weekend. We had long admired First Republic’s capabilities and culture of client service, which complement our existing affluent 6 Excluding loan loss reserves. 66 strategy. We already serve customers across the wealth spectrum, but the acquisition will help us deepen relation- ships with the affluent segment. In 2023, we prioritized stabilizing First Republic’s existing business. We retained the vast majority of customers, and deposits have increased approximately 20% since the acquisition. While we are on track against key integration milestones, 2024 will be critical as we aim to largely complete integration efforts by year-end. 2024 LOOK AHEAD Macro factors The macro environment going forward will likely look very different from 2023. While we anticipate the Federal Reserve will lower rates this year, the trajectory is still uncertain. Lower rates will be a headwind for deposit margins but a tailwind for businesses such as Home Lending. The diversification of our franchise provides natural offsets and hedges and creates resiliency in earnings and performance. We are rigorous in monitoring our portfo - lios at a granular level using multiple data sources to assess direct risk and the overall health of consumers and small businesses. Based on what we’re seeing, consumers and small businesses both still remain generally healthy. Although consumers have largely spent the excess cash reserves built up from the fiscal response to the pandemic, balance sheets remain strong. Spending on a per account basis is largely flat year-over- year. Delinquencies played out as expected in 2023, and credit card losses should fully normalize later this year. Regulatory environment The banking industry is facing an unprec- edented barrage of untested and unstud - ied proposed regulations and legislation targeting multiple aspects of our busi - ness. The combined impact of all of these — Basel III , Regulation II (Debit Card Interchange Fees), overdraft and late fee changes, the Consumer Financial Protec- tion Bureau’s Sections 1033 and 1071, and the Credit Card Competition Act — will meaningfully disrupt the economics of consumer financial products and services. This level of intervention will lead to some combination of the following: • Fewer financial products and services available, and the remaining ones will become more expensive and harder to access, especially for lower-income consumers. • Less investment and innovation in the financial services industry, leading to an erosion of the customer experience. • More consolidation across the industry, which will limit consumer choice. • More financial activity handled by nonbanks outside of the regulatory perimeter, increasing risk for consumers. Of course, we will comply with the final rules and regulations and are relatively well-positioned to do so. However, consumers and small businesses will likely bear the largest burden. Our hand We continue to operate from a position of strength with a relentless focus on the customer, a proven strategy and the best team. We recognize headwinds on the horizon and will adapt accordingly, taking a through-the-cycle approach to manag - ing our business. Moving forward, we’ll continue to: • Execute with excellence and a focus on efficiency and flexibility as the environ - ment around us changes. • Engage with regulators on how current proposals will negatively impact consumers and the industry. • Reshape our business where necessary in response to new regulations, balanc- ing impacts to shareholders, customers and the communities we serve. I remain very confident about the future of our franchise, yet approach the oppor- tunities and challenges we’ll face with great humility. Marianne Lake CEO, Consumer & Community Banking CONSUMER & COMMUNITY BANKING COMMERCIAL & INVESTMENT BANK 67 Commercial & Investment Bank I am equally thrilled to spend more of my time in my role as President and Chief Operating Officer, helping Jamie with firmwide, strategic priorities that will provide growth and opportunities for years to come. My focus will be on driving synergies across our lines of business, accelerating our investments in growth and innova - tion, and optimizing our resources across the firm. Priorities include harnessing data and modernizing our technology infrastructure so we can apply artificial intelligence (AI) to our businesses. This will help identify efficiencies and areas of opportunity. I also want to make sure we continue to manage and deploy capital in ways that best serve our clients, particu - larly when they need it most. In 2023, we made significant strides in key areas: In March, teams across our Consumer Banking, Private Banking, Commercial Banking and Investment Banking busi - nesses joined forces to deliver the firm’s full support to the venture ecosystem in the aftermath of the regional banking tur- moil. We are now exploring new ways to better serve this community, including tapping opportunities in the booming pri - vate markets so that we can compete effectively in this rapidly evolving area. Our payments capabilities also continue to strengthen and advance as we priori - tize innovation and resiliency. We are unique in that we can compete with fin- techs on customer experience and digital solutions while also offering the stability, expansive network and services of a global bank. Technology is reshaping the financial services landscape, and we are channel - ing its transformative power. Among our efforts, we are already using AI to onboard customers faster, combat fraud and serve up more insights to clients. We are pushing into new markets both at home and internationally. Whether it’s growing our presence in emerging mar- kets, deepening our relationships with multinational corporations, or expanding our U.S. branch network and wealth man - agement business, our strategy is guided by a commitment to clients, communities and long-term value creation. The leadership positions we have today are the result of hard work and investment over many years. We know also how hard it is to stay ahead of the pack. My promise to you, our shareholders, is that we will not be complacent. We will stay humble and hungry and strive always to be the best, most respected financial firm in the world. When Jamie asked me to lead a new orga - nization 12 years ago, I was thrilled. The firm was combining its traditional Invest- ment Bank with the Treasury & Securities Services division. The rationale was clear. The merger would create a massive franchise encom - passing the industry’s most diverse and comprehensive solutions for the world’s largest and most prominent companies, governments and institutions. From capi- tal raising and M&A advice to payments, trading and custody, the combined fran - chise would enable us to deliver a full range of products and solutions to clients around the world. As others retrenched, we believed growth would come from being global and diver- sified, having scale and providing a com- plete client offering. So we merged two divisions, identified gaps and invested in global capabilities. To this day, I believe the decisions we made then set us up for the success that we’ve had for the last decade. The proof is in the revenue, returns, rankings and market share that we’ve discussed with you over the years. This January, we announced the latest evolution of our corporate structure by merging two divisions once again: Com - mercial Banking (CB) with the Corporate & Investment Bank (CIB). As we integrate these top-notch fran - chises, I am delighted to hand the keys of this incredible organization to Jenn Piepszak and Troy Rohrbaugh. They are exceptional leaders in every way, and I know they will continue to work hard each day, leading our employees and serving our clients with heart, integrity and excellence. Daniel E. Pinto President and Chief Operating Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co. COMMERCIAL & INVESTMENT BANK 68 A decline in M&A dealmaking and the higher interest rate environment led to subdued debt capital markets and a drop in our debt underwriting fees to $2.6 billion in 2023 compared with $2.8 billion in 2022. A standout deal was the $31 billion bond deal for Pfizer to fund its acquisition of cancer drug pioneer Seagen, in which the firm had a lead role. In 2023, our equity underwriting fees were up 11% compared with 2022, and we gained market share year-over-year 1. While market uncertainty dented confi - dence in initial public offerings (IPO), the franchise led two of the year’s biggest offerings, including the $5 billion IPO of British chip designer Arm Holdings and consumer health company Kenvue’s $4 billion debut. It was another strong year for our Markets business, which generated $28 billion in revenue. Some of the uncertainty that plagued investment banking activity kept trading desks busy as clients hedged and positioned them - selves accordingly. Fixed Income Markets revenue was up 1% from 2022, driven by the Securitized Products Group and Credit, mainly offset by normalization in Currencies & Emerging Markets, while Equity Markets revenue dipped after a relatively strong performance in 2022. Clients also voted J.P. Morgan the #1 global research firm in Institutional Investor’s annual survey for the fourth year in a row. Our analysis of economies and markets, including research on some 5,200 companies across more than 80 countries, is particularly sought after during turbulent times. CIB Payments reported a record $9.3 billion in revenue in 2023, up from $7.6 billion in 2022, as it benefited from the higher interest rate environment. In January 2024, we announced an excit- ing new chapter in our decade-long growth story. The decision to bring together the firm’s major wholesale businesses to form the Commercial & Investment Bank continues a journey we have been on for a while as we seek to better support clients from their early stages of growth through to international expansion, acquisitions and beyond. The new combined business has the scale, business diversity and financial firepower to offer complete solutions across bank- ing, trading, payments and custody to middle market businesses, global compa - nies and governments in more than 100 markets. We are deeply indebted to Daniel Pinto, who built the Corporate & Investment Bank over the last 12 years with leader- ship positions across products and regions 1,2. In his time as CEO, the CIB grew revenue from $34 billion in 2011 to $49 billion in 2023 and increased net income by more than 75% during the same period, and its Investment Banking and Markets businesses have been #1 fran - chises for over a decade 1,2. It is a privilege to lead this remarkable business, and we are thrilled about the opportunities still to come. But let us first reflect on the key events and highlights of our performance in 2023. OUR PERFORMANCE IN 2023 In 2023, the CIB generated net income of $14 billion on $49 billion in revenue, mir- roring 2022’s solid performance but down from 2021’s record highs. Strong trading results and record years for our deposit- taking businesses cushioned the impact of industrywide weakness in investment banking activity, underscoring the bene - fits of our diversified business model. The year included central banks hiking rates at the fastest pace in decades, a second year of war in Ukraine and the outbreak of conflict in the Middle East, the collapse of several U.S. regional banks and recession in parts of Europe. Throughout, J.P. Morgan offered its expertise and balance sheet, helping companies, financial institutions and governments weather the storm. During the regional bank turmoil and resulting economic stress, the firm helped shore up the financial system and the economy, stepping in with bil- lions of dollars in liquidity to help banks, their clients and investors navi - gate the crisis. This was complemented by the firm helping to raise $155 billion for financial institutions in 2023. Worldwide investment banking activity was hit by the uncertain economic out - look and market conditions. Industry - wide fees shrank to a 10-year low 1, and dealmaking remained subdued, causing our own investment banking revenue to dip slightly, to $6.2 billion from $6.5 billion in 2022. Even so, the business maintained its #1 ranking in global investment banking fees with a wallet share of 8.8% 1. We also ranked #1 in debt capital markets, #2 in mergers and acquisitions (M&A), and rose to #1 in equity capital markets 1. Our M&A franchise advised on nearly 350 deals totaling more than $700 bil- lion in volume 1, including some of the year’s largest announced transactions: the $42 billion separation of Johnson & Johnson’s consumer health business, agricultural supplier Viterra’s $17 billion merger with U.S. oilseed and grain processor Bunge, and sandwich chain Subway’s $10 billion sale to Roark Capital, one of the biggest transactions in fast food history. 1 Dealogic as of January 2, 202 4 2 Coalition Greenwich Competitor Analytics (preliminary for FY2 3). Market share is based on JPMorgan Chase’s internal business structure and revenue. Ranks are based on Coalition Index Banks. COMMERCIAL & INVESTMENT BANK 69 Securities Services, our fourth major line of business in the CIB, also had a record year, reporting $4.8 billion in revenue. Sitting adjacent to the industry’s largest Markets business, it provides post-trade services to institutional asset-manager and asset-owner clients, providing safe - keeping, settlement and related services for securities in approximately 100 markets around the world. Since the CIB was formed in 2012, the Securities Services business has nearly doubled assets under custody from $17 trillion at the end of 2011 to $32 trillion at the end of 2023 3. In recent years, investments in technology have enhanced the scale and resiliency of its platforms, enabling the business to grow revenue and secure major new mandates. SIZING UP THE OPPORTUNITIES AHEAD J.P. Morgan has an exceptional blend of strengths that have continued to deliver value over time. The completeness of our products and services, talent, ongoing investments in digital technology and tools, client focus and fortress balance sheet have given the CIB strong share positions across almost all areas 1,2. We are not complacent about these lead - ership positions. The competitive land - scape for our businesses is intensifying, driven by both traditional banks as well as further growth of nonbank financial institutions. Core to our strategy is look - ing very closely at all areas of the busi - ness and pinpointing where there are weaknesses and opportunities to grow. Here are some of our target areas: The benefits of integration This year we are integrating our major wholesale businesses Commercial Banking and the Corporate & Investment Bank. There are more connections between the 3 Represents assets held directly or indirectly on behalf of clients under safekeeping, custody and servicing arrangements.

In 2023, over $3 billion in gross Investment Bank - ing and Markets revenue 6 and more than $8 billion in firmwide Payments revenue, almost half, came from Commercial Banking clients 7. With our extensive foot - print in the middle market , combined with our Investment Banking franchise, we are uniquely positioned to support middle market clients as they grow in size and complexity. At the same time, our biggest multinational and asset manager clients are navigating an increasingly complex set of challenges and need a banking partner with the scale, global reach and full-service offering to resolve them. With employees around the world supporting clients in more than 100 countries, the newly enlarged business is among the most complete institutional client franchises in the industry. Wherever companies are on their growth journey, the newly combined business will have the resources and coverage to help. Trading at scale Our trading business operates at huge scale. In 2023, in the U.S. alone, it handled more than 42 billion client orders and helped investors buy and sell nearly $11 trillion in 12,000 equity securities. Our strategy of being a complete counterparty is paying off, with our biggest institutional clients choosing to do more business with us. Accordingly, the bank’s share of the institutional client wallet has grown from 11.1% in 2018 to 13.9% in 2023 8. Being there for clients in all markets and conditions, however, demands a signifi- cant amount of capital. Although this is a headwind, the business continues to pro - vide solid returns, and we remain focused on the disciplined allocation of capital while preparing for updated U.S. capital requirements. As assets and international trade flows increase, we are modernizing platforms by moving to the cloud and increasing automation to handle greater volumes at lower cost. To capture market share, institutional trading needs to be easy and intuitive. We are investing to enhance the trading experience for clients across the life cycle of their trades, from onboarding to pre- trade services like research, execution, post-trade settlement and data services. We are investing heavily in the electronifi- cation of our credit business, bringing across some of the technology and approach behind our Equities business. Among other initiatives in 2023, J.P. Morgan launched a new algorithmic trading offering to U.S. Treasury investors to capture share in the world’s most important bond market. Private capital markets Private markets — both credit and equity — have grown significantly over the past decade. The private credit market has grown nearly fourfold over the last 10 years to more than $1.6 trillion 9, while money raised in venture capital and pri - vate equity growth deals has more than doubled over the same period 10. Our borrower and investor clients are on both sides of this growth, and we are well-positioned to serve the full range of their needs. We are growing our solution- agnostic credit strategy, deploying balance sheet where it makes sense for direct lending, in addition to our existing financ- ing and structured solutions. We are also enhancing our offering for asset managers and financial sponsors looking to deploy capital. As the private markets continue to evolve, we will remain a significant player with a goal of providing clients with a full range of financing options. 6 Includes gross revenues earned by the firm that are subject to a revenue sharing arrangement between CB and the CIB for Investment Banking and Markets products sold to CB clients.

In the past, these efforts were led largely by Commercial Banking. With our new combined franchise, we can now better serve this dynamic, fast- growing client base. We want to make clients-for-life out of the legions of tech companies and their founders by support- ing them from the earliest stages of growth up to IPO and beyond. Capital for the climate In 2023, we continued to help clients with their sustainability goals as well as scaling green solutions. Since 2021, the CIB has financed and facilitated $230 billion for green activities toward our firmwide target of $1 trillion by 2030, primarily by supporting clients with green bond underwriting and financing for renewable and clean energy. From financ- ing and capital raising to strategic advice, we are working closely with clients across industries as they aim to meet their own long-term sustainability targets. Investing for the future We are investing to scale and enhance the resiliency of our core platforms and are pioneering new technologies to move faster and improve the client experience. Across the business, we are exploring use cases for artificial intelligence. In Markets, our AI-powered Client Intelligence plat- form is starting to use data from across the business to create recommendations based on client interactions, and our Prime Finance team is harnessing AI to better manage the inventory of securities we have on hand for clients while optimizing our balance sheet for capital efficiency. Elsewhere, AI has improved the onboard- ing experience for clients, speeding up and improving the accuracy of our Know Your Customer procedures, while in Investment Banking, the technology is helping cover- age teams to pinpoint when companies might need to tap the equity markets. Our Payments business moves nearly $10 trillion 13 each day, with capabilities to send payments in more than 120 curren - cies across 160 countries. We are future- proofing its platforms and investing to help businesses across industries, such as healthcare and e-commerce accept and make payments more seamlessly. In Securities Services, an increasing focus is to provide better data services to help investor clients improve the performance of their portfolios and the operational efficiency of their businesses. In 2023, we launched the first commercial offerings on our Fusion platform, giving clients access to their custody, fund accounting and middle office data via API or the cloud. We also rolled out a tool that helps clients gather, cleanse and organize ESG data from different sources. LOOKING AHEAD The start of 2024 has brought some early encouraging signs for investment banking activity but a more mixed outlook for our Markets business. Several risks remain. Economies are still adjusting to life after the pandemic and the injection of trillions of dollars in monetary and fiscal stimulus; geopolitical challenges continue to flare; and the competitive threat is intensifying. The outcome of these is inherently unknown — they could provide both headwinds and opportunities for our business. The consistent returns created by the scale and diversity of our franchise allow us to keep investing through economic cycles. We are global with capabilities at scale, and now combined with Commercial Banking, we have the ability to become even more client-centric. Our products, services and reach coupled with incredible people and our winning culture make us especially hopeful about the future of our business. It is an honor for both of us to lead this world-class franchise, and we are excited for the opportunities in front of us. 13 Based on firmwide data using regulator y reporting guidelines prescribed by the Federal Reserve for US Title 1 planning purposes; includes internal settlements, global payments to and through third-party processors and banks, and other internal transfers. Troy Rohrbaugh Co-CEO, Commercial & Investment Bank Jennifer Piepszak Co-CEO, Commercial & Investment Bank COMMERCIAL & INVESTMENT BANK 72 Supporting the Innovation Economy: The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in March of last year was a profound moment. Thousands of founders, compa - nies and investors needed to protect their liquidity and make payroll. Many came to us, and we were ready. Because of our focus and significant investments to serve the Innovation Economy (IE) over the past decade, we were prepared. In 2023, we accelerated our strategy to support this important segment of our economy by: • Adding approximately two years’ worth of clients in just two months, with our team working around the clock for weeks to assist clients and open thousands of new accounts • Hiring more than 200 experienced bankers and senior leaders across key markets • Expanding our IE presence in eight countries, including Australia, China, Germany, Ireland, Israel, Nordics and the United Kingdom • Establishing Startup and Climate Tech Banking teams to provide deep sector expertise • Providing tailored capabilities, such as early-stage venture lending and capital raising • Investing in platforms that deliver seamless digital experiences and inte - grated payments offerings specifically designed for startups and high-growth companies Acquiring First Republic Bank: JPMorgan Chase’s acquisition of First Republic Bank (FRB) was another notable highlight of 2023. Given the overlap with CB, FRB offers a tremendous opportunity to COMMERCIAL BANKING 2023 was a dynamic and complex year, marked by geopolitical tensions, stubborn inflation, rapidly rising interest rates and a regional banking crisis. Through it all, Commercial Banking (CB) served as a source of stability for our clients and communities and remained focused on executing our strategic priorities. Amidst this market disruption, our team rose to the occasion to support thousands of new clients, expand into key markets and accelerate growth across our busi- ness. CB’s exceptional performance reflects the strength of our franchise, ongoing client focus, and sustained invest- ments in our platforms and capabilities: • Record revenue of $15.5 billion , up 35% year-over-year, reflecting higher net interest income, client acquisition and expansion into new markets • Record net income of $6.1 billion, up 46% year-over-year, and a 20% return on equity • Record Payments revenue of $8.3 billion, a 45% increase year-over-year • Gross Investment Banking revenue of $3.4 billion, a 14% increase year-over-year • Strong credit performance , with net charge-offs of 12 basis points I’m incredibly proud of our outstanding operational and financial performance. Our team’s steadfast commitment, con- sistent investments and market discipline drove our success. Moments that mattered Given the challenges several key competi - tors faced in 2023, the banking landscape changed dramatically and greatly acceler- ated the expansion of our franchise.

COMMERCIAL & INVESTMENT BANK 73 Developing powerful solutions: Our firm delivers end-to-end solutions to help our clients run their businesses more efficiently and fuel their growth. Through firmwide partnerships, CB offers customized capabilities, such as bundled services for startups and specialized payments offerings for segments like healthcare, real estate and government. These broad-based global offerings serve our clients through every stage of their life cycle. Delivering an exceptional experience: CB is making great progress to optimize our clients’ journey across every touch- point, including faster onboarding times, streamlined documentation and intuitive, self-service tools. As an example, we’ve been able to reduce our onboarding time to under 48 hours for a number of new clients, and we’re working to scale this experience. Informed by our clients’ needs and expectations, we’ll continue to invest in our operations and platforms to offer simple, efficient and digital-first experiences to our clients of all sizes. Harnessing the power of our data: CB has invested in tools and capabilities to harness the full power of our data. We’ve worked to combine our proprietary data with third-party sources to form an integrated, comprehensive data asset that enables us to better understand our clients’ needs, manage risk and drive operational efficiency. Empowering our team: One of CB’s key differentiators is — and always has been — our people. We provide our team with specialized training, collaboration and workflow tools, and content targeted to seamlessly address clients’ needs. Access to personalized data and analytics helps our team develop deep sector expertise and insights to serve clients in a highly differentiated manner. Focus on community impact CB has played an instrumental role in supporting the neighborhoods where we live and work. Our purpose-driven busi - ness helps to create an inclusive econ- omy, narrow the racial wealth gap and drive sustainable economic growth. We’re a pivotal part of the firm’s community impact, but our work is more than that — it’s essential to uplifting the places we call home. In 2023 alone, CB extended more than $18 billion to help communities thrive, including: • $6 billion to vital institutions, such as hospitals, governments and schools • $3 billion in loans to emerging middle market businesses • $5 billion to create and preserve over 41,000 affordable housing units • $580 million in New Markets Tax Credit financing to support community development projects • $240 million to community development financial institutions deepen our presence in high-growth markets, expand our client franchise and build upon our team. CB added more than 5,000 Commercial Real Estate clients and approximately 2,000 Middle Market clients along with high-quality loans and deposits. We’re making steady progress on the integration and are excited about the synergies between our businesses and strength of our combined teams. Executing a proven strategy Despite these unexpected events, we made tremendous progress executing against our long-term, through-the-cycle strategy. Building deep, enduring relationships: CB provides local expertise to nearly 70,000 clients across markets and sec- tors around the world. We welcomed close to 5,000 2 businesses last year and added roughly 500 bankers to build these relationships. In addition to supporting clients in all 50 states, we established a presence in Israel, Malaysia and Singa- pore, increasing our coverage of non-U.S. headquartered clients across 27 countries. #1 Multifamily Lender in the U.S.3 Middle Market, Market Penetration and Lead Share4 Emerging Middle Market, Primary Bank Market Share5 Middle Market Syndicated Lender 6 2 Excludes First Republic Bank. 3 S&P Global Market Intelligence . 4 Coalition Greenwich. 5 Barlow Research Associates. 6 London Stock Exchange Group. NOTABLE #1 RECOGNITIONS IN 2023 74 Our future is bright By all measures, 2023 was a standout year with our success driven 100% by our people. I’d like to extend my heartfelt gratitude to my extraordinary CB col - leagues and partners across the firm whose unwavering commitment not only contributed to our performance but also supported our clients throughout this remarkable year. My continued confidence in our future reflects our proven strategy, as well as our commitment to being our clients’ most important financial partner. An ambitious agenda awaits, and we’re not standing still. To build upon our strong momentum, we’ll remain disciplined as we accelerate our investments to drive our business forward. As announced earlier this year, we’re excited to bring together the strengths and capabilities of CB and the Corporate & Investment Bank. This strategic combi - nation further solidifies our strong part - nerships across wholesale banking and creates the most global, complete and diversified Commercial & Investment Bank in the world. With an incredible team, extraordinary client franchise, iconic brand and unmatched capabilities, one thing is abundantly clear: Our future is bright. Douglas B. Petno Co-Head, Global Banking, Former CEO, Commercial Banking SPOTLIGHT ON NEW YORK CITY NEW YORK CITY For over 200 years, JPMorgan Chase has proudly served clients and communities across New York City (NYC). CB supports over 7,000 clients in NYC and has extended nearly $9 billion in financing to affordable housing developers, vital institutions and local businesses since 2019. Through a multimillion-dollar investment and a dedicated team, the firm is helping Carver Federal Savings Bank serve communities through its seven NYC branches, including four in Brooklyn. Founded in 1948, Carver is one of the nation’s largest Black-managed minority depository institutions and a community development financial institution. CB has supported The City of New York for more than 50 years, providing 60 NYC agencies with services, including lending, fraud prevention, treasury services, and more. CB invested in $10.6 million of New Markets Tax Credit allocation to expand Urban Health Plan’s Plaza Del Sol Family Health Center. This facility provides access to primary and specialty care, behavioral health, nutrition, telehealth, and social services, such as the Women, Infants and Children (WIC) program. CB provided Bronx Pro Group and Services for the Underserved with a $51 million standby letter of credit to support the new construction of Melrose North. This development includes 170 units of affordable housing, improved energy efficiency and tenant amenities, and a youth training and employment center. BROOKLYN MANHATTAN THE BRONX QUEENS COMMERCIAL & INVESTMENT BANK ASSET & WEALTH MANAGEMENT 75 Asset & Wealth Management A landmark year setting the stage for future success RECORD NEW CLIENTS AND FLOWS Nearly half a trillion dollars — $490 billion to be precise. That sum represents how much net new money clients entrusted to J.P. Morgan Asset & Wealth Management (AWM) last year. During times of financial crises or market uncertainty, J.P. Morgan shines even brighter as a port in the storm — and 2023 was no exception. The U.S. regional banking crises served as a stark reminder that banking and lend - ing are not to be treated as a commodity. As a reflection of this awareness, AWM drew an influx of client flows last year at a rate nearly twice that of our closest pub - licly listed competitor. STRONG INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE AND LEADING SOLUTIONS FOR CLIENTS As a fiduciary, delivering strong, long- term investment performance is our fore- most priority. Approximately 80% of J.P. Morgan Asset Management assets under management (AUM) outperformed the peer median over a 10-year time period. This exceptional investment per- formance is an outcome of decades of refinement and involves close to 1,300 investment professionals along with one of the industry’s largest research budgets, which enables us to actively cover nearly 2,500 public companies, with over 5,000 company visits annually. This has resulted in 93% of our equity assets outperforming their peers over the past decade. Achieving outstanding investment results is never easy, but after several years of extensive quantitative easing — which often led to undifferentiated asset moves in concert with one another — we are returning to a market that prioritizes fun- damentals in valuing companies and securities, giving us plenty of reasons to be optimistic about the future for our investors across asset classes. We provide our clients with expertise and effective solutions to support them through all market cycles and prepare them for the future.

Simultaneously, to assist our clients in navigating the intricacies of retirement, we offer robust strategies through our SmartRetirement solutions. Our dedication to research is at the heart of everything we do, from stock selection to unique market and asset allocation insights. For example, we deliver exclu - sive insights to our clients through our proprietary, industry-leading Eye on the Market and J.P. Morgan Guide to the Markets, viewed by hundreds of thou- sands of financial advisors and millions of clients every year. And we draw on the depth and breadth of our market and economic expertise to provide insights into investment themes to enable more confident portfolio decisions. Clients rely on us to help them distinguish the signals from the noise. IMPRESSIVE RESULTS FOR SHAREHOLDERS Our success across our preeminent diver- sified investment and client franchises drives our consistent growth. This year, our total client assets grew to a record $5 trillion, our revenue to a record $20 bil- lion and our pre-tax income to a record $7 billion — resulting in a return on equity of 31%. These results underscore the power of a global, highly diversified platform with exceptional investment performance and dedicated client service. PERSONALIZATION, GOVERNANCE AND STEWARDSHIP I have never in my time running the AWM franchise found two clients alike in their needs, goals and risk tolerances for their assets. For a sovereign wealth fund or a first-time individual investor, investing is deeply nuanced in terms of volatility tolerances, income and distribution requirements, taxes, preferences and passions. The proprietary technologies we gained from our acquisitions of 55ip and OpenInvest, for example, enable us to combine over 600 different invest - ment strategies to create highly custom - ized portfolios in a smart, efficient way. We know our clients have a choice — not only in managers and investment styles but also in preferences around sectors or tilts and, where appropriate, in a tax- optimized way. We do not believe it is J.P. Morgan’s job to tell clients what to include or exclude inside their portfolio sectors or stock selection. Instead, we empower clients to guide us and drive their own decisions. And because preferences are often personal in nature, we are steadfast in focusing our stewardship on voting matters that maximize long-term share- holder value and good governance. With the increased prevalence of outsourcing proxy voting, by the end of 2024, generally we will have eliminated third-party proxy advisor voting recommendations from our internally developed voting systems. We believe these enhancements will allow companies to better understand our inde- pendent rationale regarding voting issues. INVESTING FOR THE FUTURE Active ETFs and SMAs Innovation forms the core of our business. Having launched our active exchange-traded fund (ETF) platform less than 10 years ago, we have emerged as a global leader — ranking #2 in AUM and net flows, led by having the #1, #3 and #5 largest actively managed ETFs A Record Year Delivering Strong Results $20B Revenue $7B Pre-tax Income $5B Net Income $490B Flows $5T Client Assets $228B Loans (EOP) = recordP P P P P P P GLOBAL ACTIVE ETF RANKING No. Fund Name Ticker Total Assets 1 JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF JEPI $32.8 2 Dimensional US Core Equity 2 ETF DFAC $26.1 3 JPMorgan Ultra-Short Income ETF JPST $22.5 4 PIMCO Enhanced Short Maturity Active ETF MINT $10.8 5 JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF JEPQ $10.8 ($ in billions) Source: Morningstar as of February 29, 2024, excludes GBTC EOP = End of period 77 and thought leadership are critical ele - ments. I am confident that our capabili- ties and commitment to future-focused investments, as well as enhancements using technology and AI, will bolster our ability to serve our clients and empower them to attain their future success. By achieving optimal results through these efforts, clients reward us with their flows, and future growth will follow. Furthermore, we hold a unique advan - tage that sets us apart from all of our competitors: Being part of JPMorgan Chase provides us with unmatched resources, opportunities and scale. I am so proud of how we helped our clients and shareholders navigate the challenges of 2023 and previous market cycles. Our industry-leading growth of client assets is a testament to our unwav - ering commitment to delivering on our fiduciary responsibilities and dedication to serving clients’ best interests. We are deeply grateful for this trust and will continue to strive for excellence in all we do, each and every day. in the world (JPMorgan Equity Premium Income, JPMorgan Ultra-Short Income and JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income). We persist in our efforts to innovate, expanding our offerings by launching 17 new solutions (12 U.S. and five UCITS) in the past year. We are equally enthusiastic about our separately managed account (SMA) platform. Acquiring 55ip enabled us to provide our clients with improved tax management and portfolio customiza - tion, and our clients now have greater control over their investments and taxes. Since the acquisition, our AUM increased 16-fold in this area. Alternatives As a top 10 manager and investor, with more than $400 billion in assets and a 60-year legacy, we continue to invest in scaling and expanding our alternatives capabilities across private equity, hedge funds, private credit, real estate and infrastructure. After launching J.P. Morgan Private Capital two years ago, we success- fully introduced technology, consumer and life sciences strategies. As access to alternatives continues to widen, we launched J.P. Morgan Real Estate Income Trust (JPMREIT) and JPMorgan Private Markets Fund (JPMF), which is one of the industry’s first private equity funds avail- able to individual investors. Overall, alter- natives across AWM continue to grow. Acquisitions Global Shares, a share plan administrator of both public and private companies around the world, is one of our most recent acquisitions. As we build out our broader J.P. Morgan Workplace offering, we are leveraging Global Shares as the foundation to help new companies acceler- ate growth and encourage employees and owners to invest. With plan participants from over 100 countries, the number continues to grow — up 15% this past year. Just as impressive, client assets are up 32% since the acquisition. We also com- pleted the acquisition of China Interna- tional Fund Management (CIFM), rebrand- ing it as J.P. Morgan Asset Management (China). We commemorated this pivotal rebrand by moving 400 new onshore col- leagues into Shanghai Tower. This served not only as a celebration but also as a testament to our shared heritage, global strengths and deep-rooted expertise in the local market, as J.P. Morgan’s history in China dates back more than 100 years. A rigorously controlled environment To ensure scalable growth, we are committed to operational excellence — from enhancing trades, client transac- tions and money movement to simplifying interactions and implementing robust controls and safeguards. Some of these efforts are being further enhanced using AI to streamline our processes, manage risk and make informed decisions to protect our clients. Additionally, these investments in our infrastructure help us — as fiduciaries — perform optimized stress testing of client portfolios on a consistent basis. CONCLUSION As I have said from the beginning of my tenure as CEO of AWM, our focus is on being the best in the industry, not the biggest. And by best, I mean the best performer for clients.

ASSET & WEALTH MANAGEMENT CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY 78 Corporate Responsibility Across the firm, we believe that the strength of our company is inextricably linked to the vitality of our communities. When families do well, we do well. When communities thrive, we thrive. In Corporate Responsibility (CR), we put this philosophy into action by operating at the nexus of business, policy and commu- nity. We understand that complex prob- lems aren’t solved with a single grant or meeting but rather require multifaceted solutions. This is why we have brought together our philanthropy, government relations, research and policy, sustainabil- ity and community engagement functions to tackle inclusive economic growth as one team. Our integrated model allows us to tap a wide-ranging set of tools and perspectives to address societal issues impacting our clients, customers and employees and drive favorable conditions for the firm’s continued success. We are not just committed to delivering for communities — we are built for it. With team members around the globe, we part- ner with local residents to understand what’s happening on the ground and how JPMorgan Chase can use its unique exper- tise and resources to maximize impact. Recognizing that there is no one-size-fits- all approach, our local strategies are inform- ed by global insights yet intentionally tai- lored to the local context, whether that is a region, neighborhood or even city block. To me, there is nothing more rewarding than seeing our impact up close. In that spirit, I invite you to learn about our work in Washington, D.C., Maryland and Virginia (Greater Washington); the United Kingdom (U.K.); Dallas-Fort Worth; and Chicago. These place-based case studies showcase the breadth and depth of our engage- ments in hundreds of communities around the world — and show that working in lockstep with communities is critical to promoting a strong business environment. GREATER WASHINGTON Landscape While the firm has operated in Greater Washington for more than 50 years, over the past decade we have made a concerted effort to advance our business footprint by opening new branches, hiring local employ- ees, lending to small businesses and con- tributing in other ways. We have intention- ally invested in areas where we can grow alongside communities and help residents achieve financial security, especially in Washington, D.C., and Baltimore, two cities with significant racial wealth divides. Our approach We have pursued initiatives to address these disparities and lift up the region’s residents and workforce. • In D.C., we provided $3 million to help la unch the Congress Heights Community Training and Development Corporation’s (CHCTDC) small business career and skills building incubator in Wards 7 and 8. • We partnered with Baltimore’s Mayor’s Offi ce of Employment Development to launch our Baltimore Virtual Call Center, hiring 40 Baltimore-based cus- tomer service specialists and leaders. • Working with the Greater Washington Par tnership and Education Strategy Group — and with support from local government leaders in D.C., Maryland and Virginia — we recommitted $5.4 million to the TalentReady initiative to support the preparation of high school students across the region for in-demand careers, building on our previous com- mitment that engaged more than 25,000 students across five school districts. Our impact in action We first worked with Monica Ray at CHCTDC, where she had served as the organization’s executive director for more than two decades. Monica has devoted her career to her community, attracting investment to help improve Wards 7 and 8’s low homeownership and high poverty and unemployment rates. After years of collaborating on CHCTDC initiatives and the opening of Chase’s Community Center Branch in Skyland Town Center, Monica shared her vision about helping to launch a small business career and skills building incubator. “We are providing support and coaching for promising new businesses, as well as for entrepreneurs still in the idea stage,” she says. “Our JPMorgan Chase partnership helps us arm these socially and economi- cally disadvantaged women entrepreneurs with the processes and systems they need to succeed in their business ventures.” Monica and her team have already helped launch 83 new businesses and are grow - ing 47 more, creating jobs and building individual and community wealth. THE UNITED KINGDOM Landscape The U.K. has long been an important mar- ket for our firm. With over 22,000 employ- ees, our offerings have continued to grow with the 2021 launch of the Chase digital consumer bank and the expansion in the U.K. of our commercial banking, invest- ment banking and asset management businesses. While our presence has evolved, the country’s economic landscape has experienced historic changes, with ongoing income inequality and nearly 22% of U.K. residents living in poverty . CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY 79 Our approach To address some of the challenges facing the U.K., we have focused on helping busi- nesses succeed, supporting individuals as they build a strong financial future and connecting people to job opportunities. This has included committing $64 million in philanthropic capital over the past five years, alongside the firm’s active employee volunteerism programs, civic partnerships, and close engagements with government and nonprofits. We have also promoted efforts to boost the U.K.’s leadership in sustainable finance, providing input on a report offering recommendations the U.K. can take to unlock capital at scale to transi- tion to a more sustainable energy system. Examples of our work to benefit local communities and economic growth include: • The Aspiring Professionals Program (A PP), run in collaboration with the Social Mobility Foundation, works to connect talented young people from low-income backgrounds with work and mentorship experiences at JPMorgan Chase. • The Founders Forward mentoring pr ogram pairs women entrepreneurs in the U.K. with JPMorgan Chase mentors, who provide business strategy and leadership development guidance. Our impact in action Over the past five years, our collective work with nonprofits has helped more than 33,000 people reduce their debts and improve their financial health. We have also provided resources to support the growth of over 10,000 small businesses and place 9,000+ individuals into appren- ticeships or full- or part-time positions. Since launching in 2012, the APP has sup- ported more than 800 young people, 86% of whom began full-time employment at JPMorgan Chase or other firms within 15 months of graduation. Radhika, currently a vice president with the firm’s Global Rates team, enrolled in APP. She credits the program with helping her build the skills she needed for the interview process and now in her sales role at the firm. Founders Forward is also changing lives. Approximately 240 women entrepreneurs in the U.K. have participated in the pro - gram. This includes Elle, whose business won a startup accelerator competition and expanded to the United States. In addition to the U.K., we are proud to offer Founders Forward in France and Germany, further embedding our commit- ment to fostering entrepreneurship into the fabric of our global company. DALLAS-FORT WORTH Landscape Texas is home to our largest employee base in the United States. With many companies like ours recognizing Texas as a great place to do business, the state is currently experiencing a skilled-labor shortage, specifically in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. This local challenge will persist: Although 85% of living-wage jobs in Dallas County require education beyond a high school degree, as of 2017, 73% of Texas’ students were not able to receive postsecondary credentials within six years, largely due to financial obstacles. Our approach To help young people access educational and skills training opportunities, we began advising and funding data-driven nonprofits, including the Commit Partnership and Tarrant To & Through (T3) Partnership, coalitions of school systems, higher education institutions, local and state governments, foundations, employers and workforce agencies, among others. While these organizations work to address compounding issues that impact student success and graduation rates, our commitments are deliberately focused on initiatives where we have expertise and insights to add the greatest value. In 2023, we committed: • $1.5 million to The Commit Partner- shi p’s Opportunity 2040 Plan Phase 1 to support a comprehensive 18-year investment plan to help improve the long-term financial health of 150,000 current students by 2040. • $750,000 to the T3 Pathways to Ca reers (P2C) platform to provide a virtual college-to-career resource to help parents and students understand what’s needed to pursue industry- based credentials, degrees, certifica - tions and job opportunities. We also promote policies at the local, state and federal levels that align with our goals. Since 2022, we have been a vocal champion of Texas’s House Bill 8 legisla- tion that creates a new funding model that incentivizes community colleges in Texas to ensure that more students complete certificates and other credentials or trans- fer to a four-year university to complete their undergraduate degree. Our impact in action Halfway through the first year, Commit - 2Dallas’s Opportunity 2040 Plan has already met 87% of its year 1 goal: to help an additional 7,700 students reach educational benchmarks that put them on a pathway to well-paying jobs. This work is touching Dallas County families like the Donjuans, whose oldest daughter Annahi will graduate from the University of North Texas at Dallas this spring. “I’m the first on both sides of my family … to obtain higher education,” says Annahi. “I decided to attend college in order to start saving and serve as a role model for my siblings.” Featured above: Elle 80 We are seeing a similar impact from our T3 P2C commitment. Over the next six months, T3 will integrate its platform with the registration process for all Fort Worth Independent School District middle school students, which will give approxi - mately 15,000 students valuable informa - tion about educational opportunities at various high schools and careers they can pursue as an adult. CHICAGO Landscape For more than 160 years, our firm has served Chicago, a city ripe with business opportunities — along with its share of challenges. Between 2017 and 2019, several reports captured the stark segre - gation and inequities among communities in Chicago, underscoring devastating impacts on economic vitality. Our approach Looking at this research and findings from the JPMorgan Chase Institute, we recognized an opportunity to change the decades-long trajectory of the city’s South and West Sides from disinvestment to revitalization. Following conversations with policymakers and residents, we focused on addressing the city’s afford- able home shortage as an opportunity to catalyze wealth building. To leverage vacant city-owned land, CR deepened partnerships with nonprofits building affordable homes in coordination with local government, including The Resurrection Project, Reclaiming Chicago and the Chicago Community Trust. These organizations target city blocks to acquire and build homes, supporting individual and community wealth. They also connect people with affordable mortgages and help them plan for costs like maintenance and repairs. Additionally, our businesses combined expertise to make one of our largest-ever affordable housing invest- ments in redeveloping the Lawson YMCA into 400+ affordable housing units. Our impact in action We see returns on our commitments in the pride and promise of new homeowners, including Janay, a public school teacher. Janay saved part of every paycheck to pur- chase her first home and put down roots. “As a teacher, building a sense of commu- nity is one of the first things I do with my students at the beginning of the year. It is a way of making students feel safe, valued and supported. This home does the same for me,” she reports. Janay’s inspiring story is one of many. Housing production from a collaborative of organizations — funded in part through grants from JPMorgan Chase — surged from 19 homes in 2022 to 79 homes in 2023, demonstrating significant progress toward the collaborative’s goal of scaling production to more than 100 homes per year through 2030. This is just the beginning. In addition to deploying $1.1 million in home loans and raising $50 million toward lending and home construction, our grantees have leveraged our philanthropic support to secure another 500 city-owned vacant lots and gain funding from the state of Illinois focused on assisting with down payments and closing appraisal gaps. LOOKING AHEAD The essence of our work outlined above can be captured in three words: We show up. As listeners, learners and community partners, we come to the table — real, tangible tables — ready to create avenues to economic opportunity. At these various tables, we ask: “What’s working?” We examine our investments with our colleagues across the firm and external partners, gaining an understand - ing of how winning approaches can be scaled to markets around the world. Our team’s work ensuring that policymakers know the value we bring to communities becomes all the more important as we seek to scale solutions during this uncer- tain political moment. It is in tandem with elected officials and other stakeholders that we have brought, and will continue to bring, the right products and services to our clients and customers. And when we show up, in good and in tough times, we will bring our holistic model, positioning ourselves to grow and truly be the bank for the place we are in, in every market we serve. We take this responsibility seriously. It is a privilege to bank more than 88 million customers and small businesses. It is a privilege to support schools, hospitals and other community institutions. But perhaps most of all, it is a privilege to lead by example, demonstrating through our business success that the private sector has a role to play in shaping a stronger, more inclusive economy for everyone.

Financial 46 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K FIVE-YEAR STOCK PERFORMANCE The following table and graph compare the five-year cumulative total return for JPMorgan Chase & Co. (“JPMorgan Chase” or the “Firm”) common stock with the cumulative return of the S&P 500 Index, the KBW Bank Index and the S&P Financials Index. The S&P 500 Index is a commonly referenced equity benchmark in the United States of America (“U.S.”), consisting of leading companies from different economic sectors. The KBW Bank Index seeks to reflect the performance of banks and thrifts that are publicly traded in the U.S. and is composed of leading national money center and regional banks and thrifts. The S&P Financials Index is an index of financial companies, all of which are components of the S&P 500. The Firm is a component of all three industry indices. The following table and graph assume simultaneous investments of $100 on December 31, 2018, in JPMorgan Chase common stock and in each of the above indices. The comparison assumes that all dividends were reinvested.

Comparisons noted in the sections below are for the full year of 2023 versus the full year of 2022, unless otherwise specified. Firmwide overview JPMorgan Chase reported net income of $49.6 billion for 2023, up 32%, earnings per share of $16.23, ROE of 17% and ROTCE of 21%. • Total net revenue was $158.1 billion, up 23%, reflecting: – Net interest income (“NII”) of $89.3 billion, up 34%, driven by higher rates, the impact of First Republic, and higher revolving balances in Card Services, partially offset by lower Markets net interest income and lower average deposit balances. NII excluding Markets was $90.0 billion, up 44%. – Noninterest revenue (“NIR”) was $68.8 billion, up 11%, driven by the impact of First Republic, including the $2.8 billion estimated bargain purchase gain, higher Markets noninterest revenue, and higher asset management fees, partially offset by the absence of the gain on the sale of Visa B shares in the prior year, higher net securities losses in Treasury and CIO, and lower auto operating lease income. • Noninterest expense was $87.2 billion, up 14%, predominantly driven by higher compensation expense, reflecting an increase in employees, primarily in technology and front office, as well as wage inflation. The increase in expense also includes the $2.9 billion FDIC special assessment and costs associated with the First Republic acquisition. • The provision for credit losses was $9.3 billion, reflecting $6.2 billion of net charge-offs and a net addition to the allowance for credit losses of $3.1 billion. Net charge-offs increased $3.3 billion, predominantly driven by Card Services, and to a lesser extent single name exposures in wholesale. The net addition to the allowance for credit losses included: – a net addition of $1.3 billion in consumer, predominantly driven by CCB, reflecting $1.4 billion in Card Services driven by loan growth, including an increase in revolving balances, partially offset by a net reduction of $200 million in Home Lending, and – a net addition of $657 million in wholesale, driven by net downgrade activity and a deterioration in the outlook for commercial real estate in CB. The net addition also included $1.2 billion to establish the allowance for First Republic loans and lending-related commitments in the second quarter of 2023. The provision in the prior year included a $3.5 billion net addition to the allowance for credit losses and net charge-offs of $2.9 billion. • The total allowance for credit losses was $24.8 billion at December 31, 2023. The Firm had an allowance for loan losses to retained loans coverage ratio of 1.75%, compared with 1.81% in the prior year. • The Firm’s nonperforming assets totaled $7.6 billion at December 31, 2023, up 5%, predominantly driven by wholesale nonaccrual loans, which reflected the impact of downgrades. Refer to Wholesale Credit Portfolio and Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 120–130 and pages 114–119, respectively, for additional information. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K 49 • Firmwide average loans of $1.2 trillion were up 13%, predominantly driven by higher loans in CCB and CB, primarily as a result of First Republic. • Firmwide average deposits of $2.4 trillion were down 4%, driven by – continued migration into higher-yielding investments in AWM, the impact of higher customer spending in CCB, continued deposit attrition in CB, and a net decline in CIB, which included actions taken to reduce certain deposits, partially offset by – the increase in deposits associated with First Republic, and growth related to the Firm’s international consumer initiatives in Corporate. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 102–109 for additional information. Selected capital and other metrics • CET1 capital was $251 billion, and the Standardized and Advanced CET1 ratios were both 15.0%. • SLR was 6.1%. • TBVPS grew 18%, ending 2023 at $86.08. • As of December 31, 2023, the Firm had eligible end-of- period High Quality Liquid Assets (“HQLA”) of approximately $798 billion and unencumbered marketable securities with a fair value of approximately $649 billion, resulting in approximately $1.4 trillion of liquidity sources.

As a result of these organizational changes, the Firm will be reorganizing its business segments to reflect the manner in which the segments will be managed. The reorganization of the business segments is expected to be effective in the second quarter of 2024. • On January 16, 2024, JPMorgan Chase announced that Mark Weinberger, 62, had been elected to its Board of Directors, effective immediately. He will also serve as a member of the Board’s Audit Committee. Mr. Weinberger served as the Global Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Ernst & Young from 2013 to 2019. Outlook These current expectations are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements are based on the current beliefs and expectations of JPMorgan Chase’s management, speak only as of the date of this Form 10-K, and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Refer to Forward-Looking Statements on page 161 and Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors section on pages 9-33 of this Form 10-K for a further discussion of certain of those risks and uncertainties and the other factors that could cause JPMorgan Chase’s actual results to differ materially because of those risks and uncertainties. There is no assurance that actual results in 2024 will be in line with the outlook information set forth below, and the Firm does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements. JPMorgan Chase’s current outlook for full-year 2024 should be viewed against the backdrop of the global and U.S. economies, financial markets activity, the geopolitical environment, the competitive environment, client and customer activity levels, and regulatory and legislative developments in the U.S. and other countries where the Firm does business. Each of these factors will affect the performance of the Firm. The Firm will continue to make appropriate adjustments to its businesses and operations in response to ongoing developments in the business, economic, regulatory and legal environments in which it operates. Full-year 2024 • Management expects net interest income to be approximately $90 billion, market dependent. • Management expects net interest income excluding Markets to be approximately $88 billion, market dependent. • Management expects adjusted expense to be approximately $90 billion, market dependent. • Management expects the net charge-off rate in Card Services to be less than 3.50%. Net interest income excluding Markets and adjusted expense are non-GAAP financial measures. Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s Use of Non- GAAP Financial Measures on pages 62–64. 52 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K Business Developments First Republic acquisition On May 1, 2023, JPMorgan Chase acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of First Republic Bank (the \"First Republic acquisition\") from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”), as receiver. JPMorgan Chase’s Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the period ended December 31, 2023 reflect the impact of First Republic. Where meaningful to the disclosure, the impact of the First Republic acquisition, as well as subsequent related business and activities, are disclosed in various sections of this Form 10-K. The Firm continues to convert certain operations, and to integrate clients, products and services, associated with the First Republic acquisition to align with the Firm’s businesses and operations. Refer to Note 34 and page 67 for additional information related to First Republic. Interbank Offered Rate (“IBOR”) transition The publication of the remaining principal tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR (i.e., overnight, one-month, three-month, six- month and 12-month LIBOR) ceased on June 30, 2023 (“LIBOR Cessation”). The one-month, three-month and six- month tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR will continue to be published on a \"synthetic\" basis, which will allow market participants to use such rates for certain legacy LIBOR- linked contracts through September 30, 2024. As part of the Firm’s overall transition efforts which culminated in the second quarter of 2023, the Firm successfully completed the conversion of predominantly all of its remaining cleared derivatives contracts linked to U.S. dollar LIBOR to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) as part of initiatives by the principal central counterparties (“CCPs”) to convert cleared derivatives prior to LIBOR Cessation. Nearly all of the Firm’s other U.S. dollar LIBOR-linked products that remained outstanding at LIBOR Cessation have been remediated through contractual fallback provisions or through the framework provided by the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act (“LIBOR Act”). The Firm expects that the limited number of contracts remaining that reference “synthetic” U.S. dollar LIBOR will be remediated by September 30, 2024. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K 53 CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This section provides a comparative discussion of JPMorgan Chase’s Consolidated Results of Operations on a reported basis for the two-year period ended December 31, 2023, unless otherwise specified. Refer to Consolidated Results of Operations on pages 51-54 of the Firm’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 (the “2022 Form 10-K”) for a discussion of the 2022 versus 2021 results. Factors that relate primarily to a single business segment are discussed in more detail within that business segment’s results. Refer to pages 155–158 for a discussion of the Critical Accounting Estimates Used by the Firm that affect the Consolidated Results of Operations. Revenue Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2023 2022 2021 Investment banking fees $ 6,519 $ 6,686 $ 13,216 Principal transactions 24,460 19,912 16,304 Lending- and deposit-related fees 7,413 7,098 7,032 Asset management fees 15,220 14,096 14,405 Commissions and other fees 6,836 6,581 6,624 Investment securities losses (3,180) (2,380) (345) Mortgage fees and related income 1,176 1,250 2,170 Card income 4,784 4,420 5,102 Other income(a) 5,609 (b) 4,322 4,830 Noninterest revenue 68,837 61,985 69,338 Net interest income 89,267 66,710 52,311 Total net revenue $ 158,104 $ 128,695 $ 121,649 (a) Included operating lease income of $2.8 billion, $3.7 billion and $4.9 billion for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Also includes losses on tax-oriented investments. Refer to Note 6 for additional information. (b) Included the estimated bargain purchase gain of $2.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023, in Corporate associated with the First Republic acquisition. Refer to Business Segment Results on page 67, and Notes 6 and 34 for additional information. 2023 compared with 2022 Investment banking fees decreased, reflecting in CIB: • lower advisory fees due to a lower number of completed transactions, reflecting the lower level of announced deals in the current and the prior year amid a challenging environment, and • lower debt underwriting fees as challenging market conditions, primarily in the first half of the year, resulted in lower issuance activity across leveraged loans, investment-grade loans and high-grade bonds. This was largely offset by higher issuance activity in high-yield bonds driven by higher industry-wide issuance, partially offset by • higher equity underwriting fees driven by a higher level of follow-on offerings due to lower equity market volatility and a higher level of convertible securities offerings, which benefited from higher rates, partially offset by lower activity in private placements amid a challenging environment. Refer to CIB segment results on pages 72–77 and Note 6 for additional information. Principal transactions revenue increased, reflecting in CIB: • higher Equity Markets principal transactions revenue in Prime Finance and Equity Derivatives, • higher Fixed Income Markets principal transactions revenue in Securitized Products and Fixed Income Financing, largely offset by lower revenue in Rates and Currencies & Emerging Markets; – the net increase in Markets principal transactions revenue was more than offset by a decline in Markets net interest income, primarily due to higher funding costs; and • losses of $280 million in Credit Adjustments & Other compared with $836 million in the prior year. The prior year included net markdowns on held-for-sale positions, primarily unfunded commitments, in the bridge financing portfolio in CIB and CB. The increase in principal transactions revenue also included the impact of higher short-term cash deployment activities in Treasury and CIO, reflective of the current interest rate environment. Principal transactions revenue in CIB generally has offsets across other revenue lines, including net interest income. The Firm assesses the performance of its Markets business on a total net revenue basis. Refer to CIB and Corporate segment results on pages 72–77 and pages 84–85, respectively, and Note 6 for additional information. Lending- and deposit-related fees increased, reflecting: • higher lending-related revenue driven by the amortization of the purchase discount on certain acquired lending-related commitments associated with First Republic, primarily in AWM and CB, predominantly offset by • lower deposit-related fees in CB and CIB driven by the higher level of client credits that reduce such fees. Refer to CIB, CB and AWM segment results on pages 72–77, pages 78–80 and pages 81–83, respectively, and Note 6 for additional information. Asset management fees increased driven by strong net inflows and the removal of most money market fund fee waivers in the prior year in AWM, and in CCB the impact of First Republic, as well as higher average market levels and strong net inflows. Refer to CCB and AWM segment results on pages 68–71 and pages 81–83, respectively, and Note 6 for additional information. 54 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K Commissions and other fees increased due to higher commissions on annuity sales and travel-related services in CCB. Refer to CCB segment results on pages 68–71 and Note 6 for additional information. Investment securities losses reflected higher net losses on higher sales of U.S. Treasuries and U.S. GSE and government agency MBS, associated with repositioning the investment securities portfolio in both periods in Treasury and CIO. Refer to Corporate segment results on pages 84– 85 and Note 10 for additional information. Mortgage fees and related income: refer to CCB segment results on pages 68–71, Note 6 and 15 for further information. Card income increased in CIB and CB, reflecting growth in merchant processing volume and Commercial Card transactions in J.P. Morgan Payments; and in CCB, driven by higher net interchange income on increased debit and credit card sales volume. Refer to Business Segment Results, CCB, CIB and CB segment results on pages 65–85, pages 68–71, pages 72–77 and pages 78–80, respectively, and Note 6 for further information. Other income increased, reflecting: • the $2.8 billion estimated bargain purchase gain in Corporate associated with the First Republic acquisition, • the impact of net investment hedges in Treasury and CIO, and • a gain of $339 million recognized in the first quarter of 2023 in AWM on the original minority interest in China International Fund Management (“CIFM”) upon the Firm's acquisition of the remaining 51% interest in the entity, partially offset by • lower auto operating lease income in CCB due to a decline in volume, • lower net gains related to certain other Corporate investments, and • the net impact of equity investments in CIB, including impairment losses in the second half of 2023, The prior year included: • a gain of $914 million on the sale of Visa B shares and proceeds from an insurance settlement in Corporate, and • a gain on an equity-method investment received in partial satisfaction of a loan in CB. Refer to Business Segment Results on page 67 and Note 34 for additional information on the First Republic acquisition; Note 5 for additional information on net investment hedges; and Note 6 for further information. Net interest income increased driven by higher rates, the impact of First Republic, and higher revolving balances in Card Services, partially offset by lower Markets net interest income and lower average deposit balances. The Firm’s average interest-earning assets were $3.3 trillion, down $23 billion, and the yield was 5.14%, up 236 basis points (“bps”). The net yield on these assets, on an FTE basis, was 2.70%, an increase of 70 bps. The net yield excluding Markets was 3.85%, up 125 bps. Refer to the Consolidated average balance sheets, interest and rates schedule on pages 310-314 for further information. Net yield excluding Markets is a non-GAAP financial measure. Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures on pages 62–64 for a further discussion of Net yield excluding Markets. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K 55 Provision for credit losses Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2023 2022 2021 Consumer, excluding credit card $ 935 $ 506 $ (1,933) Credit card 6,048 3,353 (4,838) Total consumer 6,983 3,859 (6,771) Wholesale 2,299 2,476 (2,449) Investment securities 38 54 (36) Total provision for credit losses $ 9,320 $ 6,389 $ (9,256) 2023 compared with 2022 The provision for credit losses was $9.3 billion, reflecting $6.2 billion of net charge-offs and a net addition of $3.1 billion to the allowance for credit losses. Net charge-offs increased $3.3 billion, consisting of $2.6 billion in consumer, predominantly driven by Card Services, as the portfolio continued to normalize to pre-pandemic levels, and $698 million in wholesale. The net addition to the allowance for credit losses included $1.9 billion, consisting of: • $1.3 billion in consumer, predominantly driven by CCB, reflecting a $1.4 billion net addition in Card Services, partially offset by a net reduction of $200 million in Home Lending. The net addition in Card Services was driven by loan growth, including an increase in revolving balances, partially offset by reduced borrower uncertainty. The net reduction in Home Lending was driven by improvements in the outlook for home prices; and • $657 million in wholesale, driven by net downgrade activity and the net effect of changes in the Firm's weighted average macroeconomic outlook, including a deterioration in the outlook for commercial real estate in CB, partially offset by the impact of changes in the loan and lending-related commitment portfolios. The net addition also included $1.2 billion to establish the allowance for the First Republic loans and lending-related commitments in the second quarter of 2023. The provision in the prior year included a $3.5 billion net addition to the allowance for credit losses , consisting of $2.3 billion in wholesale and $1.2 billion in consumer, driven by loan growth and deterioration in the Firm’s macroeconomic outlook, partially offset by a reduction in the allowance related to a decrease in uncertainty associated with borrower behavior as the effects of the pandemic gradually receded, and net charge-offs of $2.9 billion.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K 57 CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AND CASH FLOWS ANALYSIS Consolidated balance sheets analysis The following is a discussion of the significant changes between December 31, 2023 and 2022. Refer to pages 155–158 for a discussion of the Critical Accounting Estimates Used by the Firm that affect the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Selected Consolidated balance sheets data December 31, (in millions) 2023 2022 Change Assets Cash and due from banks $ 29,066 $ 27,697 5 % Deposits with banks 595,085 539,537 10 Federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements 276,152 315,592 (12) Securities borrowed 200,436 185,369 8 Trading assets 540,607 453,799 19 Available-for-sale securities 201,704 205,857 (2) Held-to-maturity securities 369,848 425,305 (13) Investment securities, net of allowance for credit losses 571,552 631,162 (9) Loans 1,323,706 1,135,647 17 Allowance for loan losses (22,420) (19,726) 14 Loans, net of allowance for loan losses 1,301,286 1,115,921 17 Accrued interest and accounts receivable 107,363 125,189 (14) Premises and equipment 30,157 27,734 9 Goodwill, MSRs and other intangible assets 64,381 60,859 6 Other assets 159,308 182,884 (13) Total assets $ 3,875,393 $ 3,665,743 6 % Cash and due from banks and deposits with banks increased reflecting the higher level of excess cash placed with the Federal Reserve Banks. The Firm’s excess cash primarily resulted from: • the net issuance of long-term debt, and • the impact of maturities and paydowns of investment securities in Treasury and CIO, partially offset by • the impacts associated with the First Republic acquisition in the first half of 2023. Federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements decreased, reflecting a reduction in client- driven market-making activities, partially offset by higher cash deployment in Treasury and CIO. Securities borrowed increased driven by Markets, reflecting a higher demand for securities to cover short positions and client-driven activities. Refer to Note 11 for additional information on securities purchased under resale agreements and securities borrowed. Trading assets increased, reflecting in Markets higher debt and equity instruments on client-driven market-making activities, partially offset by lower derivative receivables, primarily as a result of market movements. Refer to Notes 2 and 5 for additional information. Investment securities decreased due to: • lower available-for-sale (\"AFS\") securities driven by maturities and paydowns, predominantly offset by the impact of First Republic, net purchases, and the transfer of securities from held-to-maturity (“HTM”) in the first quarter of 2023, and • lower HTM securities driven by maturities and paydowns, and the transfer of securities to AFS. Refer to Corporate segment results on pages 84–85, Investment Portfolio Risk Management on page 134 and Notes 2 and 10 for additional information on investment securities. Loans increased, reflecting: • $146 billion of loans associated with First Republic, • growth in new accounts in Card Services, as well as higher revolving balances, which continued to normalize to pre- pandemic levels, and • growth in Auto loans due to net originations. The allowance for loan losses increased, reflecting: • a net addition to the allowance for loan losses of $2.2 billion, consisting of: – $1.3 billion in consumer, predominantly driven by CCB, reflecting $1.4 billion in Card Services driven by loan growth, including an increase in revolving balances, partially offset by a net reduction of $176 million in Home Lending, and – $930 million in wholesale, driven by net downgrade activity and the net effect of changes in the Firm's weighted average macroeconomic outlook, and • $1.1 billion to establish the allowance for the First Republic loans in the second quarter of 2023. The allowance for loan losses also reflected a reduction of $587 million, on January 1, 2023, as a result of the adoption of the Financial Instruments - Credit Losses: Troubled Debt Restructurings accounting guidance. 58 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K References in this Form 10-K to \"changes to the TDR accounting guidance\" pertain to the Firm's adoption of this guidance. There was also a $408 million net reduction in the allowance for lending-related commitments recognized in other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets. Refer to Consolidated Results of Operations and Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages 54–57 and pages 111–134, respectively, and Notes 2, 3, 12 and 13 for additional information on loans and the total allowance for credit losses; and Business Segment Results on page 67 and Note 34 for additional information on the First Republic acquisition. Accrued interest and accounts receivable decreased due to lower client receivables related to client-driven activities in Markets. Premises and equipment increased as a result of the construction-in-process associated with the Firm's headquarters, the First Republic acquisition, largely lease right-of-use assets, and higher capitalized software. Refer to Note 16 and 18 for additional information. Goodwill, MSRs and other intangibles increased predominantly due to: • other intangibles and goodwill related to the acquisition of the remaining 51% interest in CIFM, • core deposit intangibles associated with the First Republic acquisition, and • higher MSRs as a result of net additions primarily from purchases, and the impact of higher interest rates, partially offset by the realization of expected cash flows. Refer to Note 15 and 34 for additional information. Other assets decreased reflecting the impact of the change in the type of collateral placed with CCPs from cash to securities. Selected Consolidated balance sheets data December 31, (in millions) 2023 2022 Change Liabilities Deposits $ 2,400,688 $ 2,340,179 3 Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements 216,535 202,613 7 Short-term borrowings 44,712 44,027 2 Trading liabilities 180,428 177,976 1 Accounts payable and other liabilities 290,307 300,141 (3) Beneficial interests issued by consolidated variable interest entities (“VIEs”) 23,020 12,610 83 Long-term debt 391,825 295,865 32 Total liabilities 3,547,515 3,373,411 5 Stockholders’ equity 327,878 292,332 12 Total liabilities and stockholders’ equity $ 3,875,393 $ 3,665,743 6 % Deposits increased, reflecting the net impact of: • higher balances in CIB due to net issuances of structured notes as a result of client demand, as well as deposit inflows from client-driven activities in Payments and Securities Services, partially offset by deposit attrition, including actions taken to reduce certain deposits, • growth in Corporate related to the Firm's international consumer initiatives, • lower balances in CCB reflecting higher customer spending, • a decline in AWM due to continued migration into higher- yielding investments driven by the higher interest rate environment, predominantly offset by growth from new and existing customers as a result of new product offerings, and • a decrease in CB due to continued deposit attrition as clients seek higher-yielding investments, predominantly offset by the retention of inflows associated with disruptions in the market in the first quarter of 2023. The net increase also included $61 billion of deposits associated with First Republic, primarily reflected in CCB, AWM and CB. Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements increased, reflecting the impact of a lower level of netting on reduced repurchase activity. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 102–109 for additional information on deposits, federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements, and short-term borrowings; Notes 2 and 17 for deposits and Note 11 for federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements; Business Segment Results on page 67 and Note 34 for additional information on the First Republic acquisition. Trading liabilities increased due to client-driven market- making activities in Fixed Income Markets, which resulted in higher levels of short positions in debt instruments, partially offset by lower derivative payables primarily as a result of market movements. Refer to Notes 2 and 5 for additional information. Accounts payable and other liabilities decreased primarily due to lower client payables related to client-driven activities in Markets, partially offset by higher accounts payable and accrued liabilities, including the $2.9 billion payable related to the FDIC special assessment. Refer to Note 19 for additional information. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K 59 Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs increased in CIB primarily driven by higher levels of Firm- administered multi-seller conduit commercial paper held by third parties, reflecting changes in the Firm’s short-term liquidity management. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 102–109; and Notes 14 and 28 for additional information on Firm-sponsored VIEs and loan securitization trusts. Long-term debt increased, reflecting the impact of First Republic, which included the Purchase Money Note issued to the FDIC and additional FHLB advances, as well as net issuance consistent with the Firm’s long-term funding plans. The increase was also attributable to net issuances of structured notes in Markets due to client demand and an increase in fair value. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 102–109 and Note 34 for additional information on the First Republic acquisition. Stockholders’ equity: refer to Consolidated Statements of changes in stockholders’ equity on page 169, Capital Actions on page 99, and Note 24 for additional information. 60 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K Consolidated cash flows analysis The following is a discussion of cash flow activities during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. Refer to Consolidated cash flows analysis on page 57 of the Firm’s 2022 Form 10-K for a discussion of the 2021 activities. (in millions) Year ended December 31, 2023 2022 2021 Net cash provided by/(used in) Operating activities $ 12,974 $ 107,119 $ 78,084 Investing activities 67,643 (137,819) (129,344) Financing activities (25,571) (126,257) 275,993 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 1,871 (16,643) (11,508) Net increase/(decrease) in cash and due from banks and deposits with banks $ 56,917 $ (173,600) $ 213,225 Operating activities JPMorgan Chase’s operating assets and liabilities primarily support the Firm’s lending and capital markets activities. These assets and liabilities can vary significantly in the normal course of business due to the amount and timing of cash flows, which are affected by client-driven and risk management activities and market conditions. The Firm believes that cash flows from operations, available cash and other liquidity sources, and its capacity to generate cash through secured and unsecured sources, are sufficient to meet its operating liquidity needs. • In 2023, cash provided primarily reflected net income , lower other assets, and accrued interest and accounts receivable, predominantly offset by higher trading assets, lower accounts payable and other liabilities, and higher securities borrowed. • In 2022, cash provided resulted from higher accounts payable and other liabilities, lower securities borrowed, and net proceeds from sales, securitizations, and paydowns of loans held-for-sale, partially offset by higher trading assets. Investing activities The Firm’s investing activities predominantly include originating held-for-investment loans, investing in the investment securities portfolio and other short-term instruments. • In 2023, cash provided resulted from net proceeds from investment securities, proceeds from sales and securitizations of loans held-for-investment and lower securities purchased under resale agreements , largely offset by net originations of loans and net cash used in the First Republic Bank acquisition. • In 2022, cash used resulted from net originations of loans and higher securities purchased under resale agreements, partially offset by net proceeds from investment securities. Financing activities The Firm’s financing activities include acquiring customer deposits and issuing long-term debt and preferred stock. • In 2023, cash used reflected lower deposits, which included the impact of the repayment of the deposits provided to First Republic Bank by the consortium of large U.S. banks that the Firm assumed as part of the First Republic acquisition, partially offset by higher securities loaned under repurchase agreements and net proceeds from long- and short-term borrowings . • In 2022, cash used reflected lower deposits, partially offset by net proceeds from long- and short-term borrowings. • For both periods, cash was used for repurchases of common stock and cash dividends on common and preferred stock. * * * Refer to Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis on pages 58– 60, Capital Risk Management on pages 91-101, and Liquidity Risk Management on pages 102–109, and the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows on page 170 for a further discussion of the activities affecting the Firm’s cash flows. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K 61 Year ended December 31,Year ended December 31, EXPLANATION AND RECONCILIATION OF THE FIRM’S USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES Non-GAAP financial measures The Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP; these financial statements appear on pages 166–170. That presentation, which is referred to as “reported” basis, provides the reader with an understanding of the Firm’s results that can be tracked consistently from year-to-year and enables a comparison of the Firm’s performance with the U.S. GAAP financial statements of other companies. In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, management reviews Firmwide results, including the overhead ratio, on a “managed” basis; these Firmwide managed basis results are non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm also reviews the results of the LOBs on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts, in each case, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the reportable business segments) on an FTE basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. These financial measures allow management to assess the comparability of revenue from year-to-year arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the LOBs. Management also uses certain non-GAAP financial measures at the Firm and business-segment level because these other non-GAAP financial measures provide information to investors about the underlying operational performance and trends of the Firm or of the particular business segment, as the case may be, and therefore facilitate a comparison of the Firm or the business segment with the performance of its relevant competitors. Refer to Business Segment Results on pages 65–85 for additional information on these non-GAAP measures. Non-GAAP financial measures used by the Firm may not be comparable to similarly named non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. The following summary table provides a reconciliation from the Firm’s reported U.S. GAAP results to managed basis. 2023 2022 2021 Year ended December 31, (in millions, except ratios) Reported Fully taxable- equivalent adjustments(a) Managed basis Reported Fully taxable- equivalent adjustments(a) Managed basis Reported Fully taxable- equivalent adjustments(a) Managed basis Other income $ 5,609 $ 3,782 $ 9,391 $ 4,322 $ 3,148 $ 7,470 $ 4,830 $ 3,225 $ 8,055 Total noninterest revenue 68,837 3,782 72,619 61,985 3,148 65,133 69,338 3,225 72,563 Net interest income 89,267 480 89,747 66,710 434 67,144 52,311 430 52,741 Total net revenue 158,104 4,262 162,366 128,695 3,582 132,277 121,649 3,655 125,304 Total noninterest expense 87,172 NA 87,172 76,140 NA 76,140 71,343 NA 71,343 Pre-provision profit 70,932 4,262 75,194 52,555 3,582 56,137 50,306 3,655 53,961 Provision for credit losses 9,320 NA 9,320 6,389 NA 6,389 (9,256) NA (9,256) Income before income tax expense 61,612 4,262 65,874 46,166 3,582 49,748 59,562 3,655 63,217 Income tax expense 12,060 4,262 16,322 8,490 3,582 12,072 11,228 3,655 14,883 Net income $ 49,552 NA $ 49,552 $ 37,676 NA $ 37,676 $ 48,334 NA $ 48,334 Overhead ratio 55 % NM 54 % 59 % NM 58 % 59 % NM 57 % (a) Predominantly recognized in CIB, CB and Corporate. 62 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K 2023 2022 20212023 2022 2021 Net interest income, net yield, and noninterest revenue excluding Markets In addition to reviewing net interest income, net yield, and noninterest revenue on a managed basis, management also reviews these metrics excluding Markets, as shown below. Markets consists of CIB’s Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. These metrics, which exclude Markets, are non- GAAP financial measures. Management reviews these metrics to assess the performance of the Firm’s lending, investing (including asset-liability management) and deposit-raising activities, apart from any volatility associated with Markets activities. In addition, management also assesses Markets business performance on a total revenue basis as offsets may occur across revenue lines. Management believes that these measures provide investors and analysts with alternative measures to analyze the revenue trends of the Firm. Year ended December 31, (in millions, except rates) 2023 2022 2021 Net interest income – reported $ 89,267 $ 66,710 $ 52,311 Fully taxable-equivalent adjustments 480 434 430 Net interest income – managed basis(a) $ 89,747 $ 67,144 $ 52,741 Less: Markets net interest income(b) (294) 4,789 8,243 Net interest income excluding Markets(a) $ 90,041 $ 62,355 $ 44,498 Average interest-earning assets $ 3,325,708 $ 3,349,079 $ 3,215,942 Less: Average Markets interest-earning assets(b) 985,777 953,195 888,238 Average interest-earning assets excluding Markets $ 2,339,931 $ 2,395,884 $ 2,327,704 Net yield on average interest-earning assets – managed basis 2.70 % 2.00 % 1.64 % Net yield on average Markets interest-earning assets(b) (0.03) 0.50 0.93 Net yield on average interest-earning assets excluding Markets 3.85 % 2.60 % 1.91 % Noninterest revenue – reported $ 68,837 $ 61,985 $ 69,338 Fully taxable-equivalent adjustments 3,782 3,148 3,225 Noninterest revenue – managed basis $ 72,619 $ 65,133 $ 72,563 Less: Markets noninterest revenue(b) 28,086 24,195 19,151 Noninterest revenue excluding Markets $ 44,533 $ 40,938 $ 53,412 Memo: Total Markets net revenue(b) $ 27,792 $ 28,984 $ 27,394 (a) Interest includes the effect of related hedges. Taxable-equivalent amounts are used where applicable. (b) Refer to pages 75-76 for further information on Markets. Calculation of certain U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures Certain U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures are calculated as follows: Book value per share (“BVPS”) Common stockholders’ equity at period-end / Common shares at period-end Overhead ratio Total noninterest expense / Total net revenue ROA Reported net income / Total average assets ROE Net income* / Average common stockholders’ equity ROTCE Net income* / Average tangible common equity TBVPS Tangible common equity at period-end / Common shares at period-end * Represents net income applicable to common equity In addition, the Firm reviews other non-GAAP measures such as: • Adjusted expense, which represents noninterest expense excluding Firmwide legal expense, and • Pre-provision profit, which represents total net revenue less total noninterest expense. Management believes that these measures help investors understand the effect of these items on reported results and provide an alternative presentation of the Firm’s performance. The Firm also reviews the allowance for loan losses to period-end loans retained excluding trade finance and conduits, a non-GAAP financial measure, to provide a more meaningful assessment of CIB’s allowance coverage ratio. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K 63 TCE, ROTCE and TBVPS TCE, ROTCE and TBVPS are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. ROTCE measures the Firm’s net income applicable to common equity as a percentage of average TCE. TBVPS represents the Firm’s TCE at period-end divided by common shares at period-end. TCE, ROTCE and TBVPS are utilized by the Firm, as well as investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity. The following summary table provides a reconciliation from the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity to TCE. Period-end Average Dec 31, 2023 Dec 31, 2022 Year ended December 31, (in millions, except per share and ratio data) 2023 2022 2021 Common stockholders’ equity $ 300,474 $ 264,928 $ 282,056 $ 253,068 $ 250,968 Less: Goodwill 52,634 51,662 52,258 50,952 49,584 Less: Other intangible assets 3,225 1,224 2,572 1,112 876 Add: Certain deferred tax liabilities(a) 2,996 2,510 2,883 2,505 2,474 Tangible common equity $ 247,611 $ 214,552 $ 230,109 $ 203,509 $ 202,982 Return on tangible common equity NA NA 21 % 18 % 23 % Tangible book value per share $ 86.08 $ 73.12 NA NA NA (a) Represents deferred tax liabilities related to tax-deductible goodwill and to identifiable intangibles created in nontaxable transactions, which are netted against goodwill and other intangibles when calculating TCE. 64 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K Period-end Average Year ended December 31, Average Year ended December 31, BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS The Firm is managed on an LOB basis. There are four major reportable business segments – Consumer & Community Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank, Commercial Banking and Asset & Wealth Management. In addition, there is a Corporate segment. The business segments are determined based on the products and services provided, or the type of customer served, and they reflect the manner in which financial information is evaluated by the Firm’s Operating Committee. Segment results are presented on a managed basis. Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures, on pages 62–64 for a definition of managed basis. JPMorgan Chase (a) Consumer Businesses Wholesale Businesses Consumer & Community Banking Corporate & Investment Bank Commercial Banking Asset & Wealth Management Banking & Wealth Management Home Lending Card Services & Auto Banking Markets & Securities Services • Middle Market Banking • Asset Management • Consumer Banking • J.P. Morgan Wealth Management • Business Banking • Home Lending Production • Home Lending Servicing • Real Estate Portfolios • Card Services • Auto • Investment Banking • Payments • Lending • Fixed Income Markets • Corporate Client Banking • Global Private Bank • Equity Markets • Securities Services • Credit Adjustments & Other • Commercial Real Estate Banking (a) As a result of the organizational changes that were announced on January 25, 2024, the Firm will be reorganizing its business segments to reflect the manner in which the segments will be managed. The reorganization of the business segments is expected to be effective in the second quarter of 2024. Refer to Recent events on page 52 for additional information. Description of business segment reporting methodology Results of the business segments are intended to present each segment as if it were a stand-alone business. The management reporting process that derives business segment results includes the allocation of certain income and expense items. The Firm periodically assesses the assumptions, methodologies and reporting classifications used for segment reporting, and therefore further refinements may be implemented in future periods. The Firm also assesses the level of capital required for each LOB on at least an annual basis. The Firm’s LOBs also provide various business metrics which are utilized by the Firm and its investors and analysts in assessing performance. Revenue sharing When business segments join efforts to sell products and services to the Firm’s clients and customers, the participating business segments may agree to share revenue from those transactions. Revenue is generally recognized in the segment responsible for the related product or service, with allocations to the other segment(s) involved in the transaction. The segment results reflect these revenue-sharing agreements. Expense allocation Where business segments use services provided by corporate support units, or another business segment, the costs of those services are allocated to the respective business segments. The expense is generally allocated based on the actual cost and use of services provided. In contrast, certain costs and investments related to corporate support units, technology and operations that are not currently utilized by any LOB are not allocated to the business segments and are retained in Corporate. Expense retained in Corporate generally includes costs that would not be incurred if the segments were stand-alone businesses, and other items not solely aligned with a particular business segment. Funds transfer pricing Funds transfer pricing (“FTP”) is the process by which the Firm allocates interest income and expense to the LOBs and Other Corporate and transfers the primary interest rate risk and liquidity risk to Treasury and CIO. The funds transfer pricing process considers the interest rate and liquidity risk characteristics of assets and liabilities and off-balance sheet products. Periodically, the methodology and assumptions utilized in the FTP process are adjusted to reflect economic conditions and other factors, which may impact the allocation of net interest income to the segments. As a result of the higher interest rate environment, the cost of funds for assets and the credits earned for liabilities have generally increased, impacting the business segments’ net interest income. During the period ended December 31, 2023, this has resulted in higher cost of funds for loans and JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K 65 Markets activities, and contributed to margin expansion on deposits. Foreign exchange risk Foreign exchange risk is transferred from the LOBs and Other Corporate to Treasury and CIO for certain revenues and expenses. Treasury and CIO manages these risks centrally and reports the impact of foreign exchange rate movements related to the transferred risk in its results. Refer to Market Risk Management on page 143 for additional information. Debt expense and preferred stock dividend allocation As part of the funds transfer pricing process, almost all of the cost of the credit spread component of outstanding unsecured long-term debt and preferred stock dividends is allocated to the reportable business segments, while the balance of the cost is retained in Corporate. The methodology to allocate the cost of unsecured long-term debt and preferred stock dividends to the business segments is aligned with the relevant regulatory capital requirements and funding needs of the LOBs, as applicable. The allocated cost of unsecured long-term debt is included in a business segment’s net interest income, and net income is reduced by preferred stock dividends, to arrive at a business segment’s net income applicable to common equity. Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 91-101 for additional information. Capital allocation The amount of capital assigned to each business segment is referred to as equity. The Firm’s current allocation methodology incorporates Basel III Standardized risk- weighted assets (“RWA”) and the global systemically important banks (“GSIB”) surcharge, both under rules currently in effect, as well as a simulation of capital in a severe stress environment. At least annually, the assumptions, judgments and methodologies used to allocate capital are reassessed and, as a result, the capital allocated to the LOBs may change.

Net revenue was $70.1 billion, up 28%. Net interest income was $55.0 billion, up 38%, driven by: • deposit margin expansion on higher rates, partially offset by lower average deposits and the impact of lower PPP loan forgiveness in Banking & Wealth Management (“BWM”), • higher Card Services NII, reflecting an increase in revolving balances, and • the impact of First Republic in Home Lending. Noninterest revenue was $15.1 billion, up 2%, driven by: • higher asset management fees due to the impact of First Republic as well as higher market levels and strong net inflows, higher commissions on annuity sales in BWM and higher other service fees associated with First Republic, • higher net interchange income on increased debit and credit card sales volume, and – In Card Services, higher annual fees and the higher net interchange income were more than offset by an increase in amortization related to new account origination costs, reflecting continued growth. Net interchange income in Card Services also reflected the impact of a reduction in rewards costs and partner payments in the first quarter of 2023 related to a periodic tax refund on airline miles redeemed and an increase to the rewards liability due to adjustments to certain reward program terms in the second quarter of 2023; • higher travel-related commissions in Card Services, predominantly offset by • lower auto operating lease income as a result of a decline in volume, and • lower mortgage fees and related income in Home Lending. Refer to Note 6 for additional information on card income, asset management fees, and commissions and other fees; and Critical Accounting Estimates on pages 155–158 for credit card rewards liability. Refer to Note 15 for further information regarding changes in the value of the MSR asset and related hedges, and mortgage fees and related income. Refer to Note 34 for additional information on the First Republic acquisition. Noninterest expense was $34.8 billion, up 12%, reflecting: • higher compensation expense, driven by an increase in employees, including the impact of First Republic in the second half of 2023 and additions primarily in bankers, advisors and technology, wage inflation and higher revenue-related compensation, as well as • higher noncompensation expense, driven by the impact of First Republic, investments in marketing and technology, the increase in the FDIC assessment announced in the prior year as well as higher legal expense, partially offset by lower auto lease depreciation on lower auto lease assets. The provision for credit losses was $6.9 billion, reflecting: • net charge-offs of $5.3 billion, up $2.6 billion, predominantly driven by Card Services, as the portfolio continued to normalize to pre-pandemic levels, • a $1.2 billion net addition to the allowance for credit losses, which included $1.4 billion in Card Services, partially offset by a net reduction of $200 million in Home Lending. The net addition in Card Services was driven by loan growth, including an increase in revolving balances, partially offset by reduced borrower uncertainty. The net reduction in Home Lending was driven by improvements in the outlook for home prices; and • $408 million to establish the allowance for the First Republic loans and lending-related commitments in the second quarter of 2023. The provision in the prior year was $3.8 billion, driven by net charge-offs of $2.7 billion and a $1.1 billion net addition to the allowance for credit losses across CCB.

Net revenue was $48.8 billion, up 1%. Banking revenue was $16.5 billion, up 7%. • Investment Banking revenue was $6.2 billion, down 4%. Excluding $257 million of markdowns on held-for-sale positions, primarily unfunded commitments, in the bridge financing portfolio recorded in the second quarter of 2022, Investment Banking revenue was down 8%. Investment Banking fees were down 5%, driven by lower advisory and debt underwriting fees, partially offset by higher equity underwriting fees. The Firm ranked #1 for Global Investment Banking fees, according to Dealogic. – Advisory fees were $2.8 billion, down 8%, due to a lower number of completed transactions, reflecting the lower level of announced deals in the current and the prior year amid a challenging environment. – Debt underwriting fees were $2.6 billion, down 8%, as challenging market conditions, primarily in the first half of the year, resulted in lower issuance activity across leveraged loans, investment-grade loans, and high-grade bonds. This was largely offset by higher issuance activity in high-yield bonds driven by higher industry-wide issuance. – Equity underwriting fees were $1.2 billion, up 11%, driven by a higher level of follow-on offerings due to lower equity market volatility and a higher level of convertible securities offerings which benefited from higher rates, partially offset by lower activity in private placements amid a challenging environment. • Payments revenue was $9.3 billion, up 22%, driven by deposit margin expansion on higher rates and fees, partially offset by the higher level of client credits that reduce such fees and lower average deposits. The net impact of equity investments was flat reflecting net markdowns in both periods, including the impact of an impairment in the current year. • Lending revenue was $1.0 billion, down 27%, driven by $494 million of fair value losses on hedges of retained loans which included an increase in hedging activity, compared to $27 million of gains in the prior year, partially offset by higher net interest income. Markets & Securities Services revenue was $32.3 billion, down 1%. Markets revenue was $27.8 billion, down 4%. • Fixed Income Markets revenue was $18.8 billion, up 1%, driven by an increase in finance and trading activity in the Securitized Products Group and improved performance in Credit Trading, predominantly offset by lower revenue in Currencies & Emerging Markets as the business substantially normalized from the prior year’s elevated levels of volatility and client activity. • Equity Markets revenue was $9.0 billion, down 13%, driven by lower revenue in Equity Derivatives and Cash Equities, compared with a stronger performance in the prior year. • Securities Services revenue was $4.8 billion, up 6%, driven by deposit margin expansion on higher rates, largely offset by lower average deposits and fees. • Credit Adjustments & Other was a loss of $280 million, compared with a loss of $836 million in the prior year. Noninterest expense was $28.6 billion, up 5%, driven by higher legal expense, compensation expense, including the impact of wage inflation, and higher indirect tax expense. The provision for credit losses was $121 million, driven by net charge-offs of $272 million, up $190 million, driven by single name exposures, largely offset by a $151 million net reduction in the allowance for credit losses. The net reduction in the allowance was driven by the impact of changes in the loan and lending-related commitment portfolios and the net effect of changes in the Firm’s weighted average macroeconomic outlook, predominantly offset by an addition for certain accounts receivable and net downgrade activity. The provision in the prior year was $1.2 billion, predominantly driven by a net addition to the allowance for credit losses.

Markets revenue The following table summarizes selected income statement data for the Markets businesses. Markets includes both Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. Markets revenue consists of principal transactions, fees, commissions and other income, as well as net interest income. The Firm assesses its Markets business performance on a total revenue basis, as offsets generally occur across revenue line items. For example, securities that generate net interest income may be risk-managed by derivatives that are reflected at fair value in principal transactions revenue. Refer to Notes 6 and 7 for a description of the composition of these income statement line items. Principal transactions reflects revenue on financial instruments and commodities transactions that arise from client-driven market-making activity. Principal transactions revenue includes amounts recognized upon executing new transactions with market participants, as well as “inventory- r elated revenue”, which is revenue recognized from gains and losses on derivatives and other instruments that the Firm has been holding in anticipation of, or in response to, c lient demand, and changes in the fair value of instruments used by the Firm to actively manage the risk exposure arising from such inventory. Principal transactions revenue recognized upon executing new transactions with market participants is affected by many factors including the level of client activity, the bid-offer spread (which is the difference between the price at which a market participant i s willing and able to sell an instrument to the Firm and the price at which another market participant is willing and able to buy it from the Firm, and vice versa), market liquidity a nd volatility. These factors are interrelated and sensitive to the same factors that drive inventory-related revenue, which include general market conditions, such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, credit spreads, and equity a nd commodity prices, as well as other macroeconomic conditions.

(b) Loss days represent the number of days for which Markets, which consists of Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets, posted losses to total net revenue. The loss days determined under this measure differ from the measure used to determine backtesting gains and losses. Daily backtesting gains and losses include positions in the Firm’s Risk Management value-at-risk (\"VaR\") measure and exclude certain components of total net revenue, which may more than offset backtesting gains or losses on a particular day. For more information on daily backtesting gains and losses, refer to the VaR discussion on pages 137–139.

Net interest income was $12.1 billion, up 47%, driven by: • deposit margin expansion on higher rates, partially offset by lower average deposits, and • higher average loans, including the impact from First Republic. Noninterest revenue was $3.5 billion, up 5%, driven by: • higher lending-related revenue predominantly driven by the amortization of the purchase discount on certain acquired lending-related commitments associated with First Republic, • net markups on held-for-sale positions, primarily unfunded commitments, in the bridge financing portfolio, compared with net markdowns in the prior year, and • higher investment banking revenue and card income, predominantly offset by • lower deposit-related fees due to the higher level of client credits that reduce such fees, and • the absence of a gain on an equity-method investment received in partial satisfaction of a loan. Noninterest expense was $5.4 billion, up 14%, driven by higher compensation expense, reflecting an increase in employees including front office and technology, as well as higher volume-related expense, including the impact of new client acquisitions. The provision for credit losses was $2.0 billion, reflecting: • a $1.0 billion net addition to the allowance for credit losses, driven by the net effect of changes in the Firm’s weighted average macroeconomic outlook, including a deterioration in the outlook for commercial real estate and net downgrade activity, partially offset by the impact of changes in the loan and lending-related commitment portfolios, • $608 million to establish the allowance for the First Republic loans and lending-related commitments in the second quarter of 2023; and • net charge-offs of $316 million, up $232 million, primarily driven by Real Estate, predominantly concentrated in Office. The provision in the prior year was $1.3 billion, reflecting a net addition to the allowance for credit losses. 78 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K CB product revenue consists of the following: Lending includes a variety of financing alternatives, which are primarily provided on a secured basis; collateral includes receivables, inventory, equipment, real estate or other assets.

The discount is deferred in other liabilities and recognized on a straight- line basis over the commitment period and was largely recognized in the current year as the commitments are generally short term. Refer to Note 34 for additional information. (b) Includes the gain on the original minority interest in CIFM upon the Firm’s acquisition of the remaining 51% interest in the entity. 2023 compared with 2022 Net income was $5.2 billion, up 20%. Net revenue was $19.8 billion, up 12%. Net interest income was $6.3 billion, up 20%. Noninterest revenue was $13.6 billion, up 8%. Revenue from Asset Management was $9.1 billion, up 4%, driven by: • a gain of $339 million on the original minority interest in CIFM upon the Firm's acquisition of the remaining 51% interest in the entity, and • higher asset management fees driven by strong net inflows largely offset by the net impact of foreign exchange rate movements, as well as the removal of most money market fund fee waivers in the prior year, largely offset by • lower performance fees, and • lower NII due to higher funding costs. Revenue from Global Private Bank was $10.7 billion, up 20%, driven by: • higher net interest income on higher average loans associated with First Republic, and from deposit margin expansion on higher rates, largely offset by lower average deposits, and • higher noninterest revenue, predominantly driven by the amortization of the purchase discount on certain acquired lending-related commitments associated with First Republic, partially offset by net investment valuation losses. Noninterest expense was $12.8 billion, up 8%, predominantly driven by higher compensation, including continued growth in private banking advisor teams, revenue-related compensation and the impacts of closing the Global Shares and J.P. Morgan Asset Management China acquisitions. The provision for credit losses was $159 million, predominantly driven by a $146 million addition to the allowance for credit losses to establish the allowance for the First Republic loans and lending-related commitments in the second quarter of 2023. The provision in the prior year was $128 million driven by a net addition to the allowance for credit losses. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K 81 Asset Management has two high-level measures of its overall fund performance. • Percentage of active mutual fund and active ETF assets under management in funds rated 4- or 5-star: Mutual fund rating services rank funds based on their risk adjusted performance over various periods. A 5-star rating is the best rating and represents the top 10% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 4-star rating represents the next 22.5% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 3-star rating represents the next 35% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 2-star rating represents the next 22.5% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 1-star rating is the worst rating and represents the bottom 10% of industrywide ranked funds. An overall Morningstar rating is derived from a weighted average of the performance associated with a fund’s three-, five and ten- year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. For U.S.- domiciled funds, separate star ratings are provided at the individual share class level. The Nomura “star rating” is based on three-year risk-adjusted performance only. Funds with fewer than three years of history are not rated and hence excluded from these rankings. All ratings, the assigned peer categories and the asset values used to derive these rankings are sourced from the applicable fund rating provider. Where applicable, the fund rating providers redenominate asset values into U.S. dollars. The percentage of AUM is based on star ratings at the share class level for U.S.-domiciled funds, and at a “primary share class” level to represent the star rating of all other funds, except for Japan, for which Nomura provides ratings at the fund level. The performance data may have been different if all share classes had been included. Past performance is not indicative of future results. • Percentage of active mutual fund and active ETF assets under management in funds ranked in the 1st or 2nd quartile (one, three and five years):All quartile rankings, the assigned peer categories and the asset values used to derive these rankings are sourced from the fund rating providers. Quartile rankings are based on the net-of-fee absolute return of each fund. Where applicable, the fund rating providers redenominate asset values into U.S. dollars. The percentage of AUM is based on fund performance and associated peer rankings at the share class level for U.S.-domiciled funds, at a “primary share class” level to represent the quartile ranking for U.K., Luxembourg and Hong Kong SAR funds and at the fund level for all other funds. The performance data may have been different if all share classes had been included. Past performance is not indicative of future results. “Primary share class” means the C share class for European funds and Acc share class for Hong Kong SAR and Taiwan funds. If these share classes are not available, the oldest share class is used as the primary share class.

Net revenue was $8.0 billion, compared with $80 million in the prior year, predominantly driven by higher net interest income due to higher rates, partially offset by the impact of lower Firmwide average deposit balances. Noninterest revenue was $132 million, compared with a loss of $1.8 billion in the prior year, driven by: • the $2.8 billion estimated bargain purchase gain associated with the First Republic acquisition, • higher losses in the prior year on certain revenues associated with foreign exchange rate movements that are risk-managed by Treasury and CIO, and • the impact of higher short-term cash deployment activities as a result of the current interest rate environment, partially offset by • higher net investment securities losses related to the sales of U.S. Treasuries and U.S. GSE and government agency MBS, associated with repositioning the investment securities portfolio, and • lower net gains related to certain other Corporate investments. The prior year included a gain on the sale of Visa B shares and proceeds from an insurance settlement. Noninterest expense was $5.6 billion, up $4.6 billion, predominantly driven by: • the $2.9 billion FDIC special assessment, • $1.0 billion associated with First Republic, predominantly driven by integration and restructuring costs as well as expenses recorded in the second quarter of 2023 with respect to individuals associated with First Republic who did not become employees of the Firm until July 2, 2023, • a greater benefit in the prior year on certain expenses associated with foreign exchange rate movements that are risk-managed by Treasury and CIO, • higher legal expenses, and • higher costs associated with the Firm's international consumer growth initiatives, partially offset by • lower benefits-related and real estate expenses. The net impact of movements in foreign exchange rates associated with the foreign exchange risk that was transferred to Treasury and CIO on certain revenues and expenses was not material to net income. Refer to Foreign Exchange Risk on page 66 for additional information. Refer to Note 10 and Note 13 for additional information on the investment securities portfolio and the allowance for credit losses. 84 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K The provision for credit losses was $171 million, reflecting a net addition to the allowance for credit losses related to a single name exposure, which was subsequently charged off upon the restructuring of a loan. The current period income tax benefit was driven by: • the finalization of certain income tax regulations, other tax adjustments and tax benefits associated with tax audit settlements, partially offset by • the impact from changes in the level and mix of income and expenses subject to U.S. federal, state and local taxes that also impacted the Firm's tax reserves. The income taxes associated with the First Republic acquisition are reflected in the estimated bargain purchase gain. The prior period income tax benefit was driven by benefits related to tax audit settlements as well as other tax adjustments, partially offset by a change in the level and mix of income and expenses subject to U.S. federal, state and local taxes that also impacted the Firm's tax reserves. Other Corporate also reflects the Firm's international consumer initiatives, which includes Chase U.K., the Firm's digital retail bank in the U.K.; Nutmeg, a digital wealth manager in the U.K.; and a 46% ownership stake in C6 Bank, a digital bank in Brazil. Treasury and CIO overview Treasury and CIO is predominantly responsible for measuring, monitoring, reporting and managing the Firm’s liquidity, funding, capital, structural interest rate and foreign exchange risks. The risks managed by Treasury and CIO arise from the activities undertaken by the Firm’s four major reportable business segments to serve their respective client bases, which generate both on- and off- balance sheet assets and liabilities. Treasury and CIO seeks to achieve the Firm’s asset-liability management objectives generally by investing in high- quality securities that are managed for the longer-term as part of the Firm’s investment securities portfolio. Treasury and CIO also uses derivatives to meet the Firm ’s asset- liability management objectives. Refer to Note 5 for further information on derivatives. In addition, Treasury and CIO manages the Firm’s cash position primarily through deposits at central banks and investments in short-term instruments. Refer to Liq uidity Risk Management on pages 102–109 for further information on liquidity and funding risk . Refer to Market Risk Management on pages 135–143 for information on interest rate and foreign exchange risks. The investment securities portfolio predominantly consists of U.S. and non-U.S. government securities, U.S. GSE and government agency and nonagency mortgage-backed securities, collateralized loan obligations, obligations of U.S. states and municipalities and other ABS. At December 31, 2023, the Treasury and CIO investment securities portfolio, net of the allowance for credit losses, was $569.2 billion, and the average credit rating of the securities comprising the portfolio was AA+ (based upon external ratings where available and, where not available, based primarily upon internal risk ratings).

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K 85 FIRMWIDE RISK MANAGEMENT Risk is an inherent part of JPMorgan Chase’s business activities. When the Firm extends a consumer or wholesale loan, advises customers and clients on their investment decisions, makes markets in securities, or offers other products or services, the Firm takes on some degree of risk. The Firm’s overall objective is to manage its business, and the associated risks, in a manner that balances serving the interests of its clients, customers and investors, and protecting the safety and soundness of the Firm. The Firm believes that effective risk management requires, among other things: • Acceptance of responsibility, including identification and escalation of risks by all individuals within the Firm; • Ownership of risk identification, assessment, data and management within each of the LOBs and Corporate; and • A Firmwide risk governance and oversight structure. The Firm follows a disciplined and balanced compensation framework with strong internal governance and independent oversight by the Board of Directors (the “ Board”). The impact of risk and control issues is carefully considered in the Firm’s performance evaluation and incentive compensation processes. Risk governance framework The Firm’s risk governance framework involves understanding drivers of risks, types of risks, and impacts of risks. Drivers of risks are factors that cause a risk to exist. Drivers of risks include, but are not limited to, the economic environment, regulatory or government policy, competitor or market evolution, business decisions, process or judgment error, deli berate wrongdoing, dysfunctional markets, and natural disasters. Types of risks are categories by which risks manifest themselves. The Firm’s risks are generally categorized in the following four risk types: • Strategic risk is the risk to earnings, capital, liquidity, or reputation associated with poorly designed or failed business plans or an inadequate response to changes in the operating environment. • Credit and investment risk is the risk associated with the default or change in credit profile of a client, counterparty or customer; or loss of principal or a reduction in expected returns on investments, including consumer credit risk, wholesale credit risk, and investment portfolio risk. • Market risk is the risk associated with the effect of changes in market factors, such as interest and foreign exchange rates, equity and commodity prices, credit spreads or implied volatilities, on the value of assets and liabilities held for both the short and long term. • Operational risk is the risk of an adverse outcome resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems; human factors; or external events impacting the Firm’s processes or systems. Operational risk includes cybersecurity, compliance, conduct, legal, and estimations and model risk. Impacts of risks are consequences of risks, both quantitative and qualitative. There may be many consequences of risks manifesting, including quantitative impacts such as a reduction in earnings and capital, liquidity outflows, and fines or penalties, or qualitative impacts such as damage to the Firm’s reputation, loss of clients and customers, and regulatory and enforcement actions. The Firm’s risk governance framework is managed on a Firmwide basis. The Firm has an Independent Risk Management (“IRM”) function, which is comprised of Risk Management and Compliance. The Firm’s Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) appoints, subject to approval by the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors (the “Board Risk Committee”), the Firm’s Chief Risk Officer (“CRO”) to lead the IRM function and maintain the risk governance framework of the Firm. The framework is subject to approval by the Board Risk Committee through its review and approval of the Risk Governance and Oversight Policy. The Firm’s CRO oversees and delegates authority to the Firmwide Risk Executives (“FREs”), the Chief Risk Officers of the LOBs and Corporate (“LOB CROs”), and the Firm’s Chief Compliance Officer (“CCO”), who, in turn, establish Risk Management and Compliance organizations, develop the Firm’s risk governance policies and standards, and define and oversee the implementation of the Firm’s risk governance framework. The LOB CROs oversee risks that arise in their LOBs and Corporate, while FREs oversee risks that span across the LOBs and Corporate , as well as functions and regions. Each area of the Firm giving rise to risk is expected to operate within the parameters identified by the IRM function, and within the risk and control standards established by its own management. Three lines of defense The Firm’s “three lines of defense” are as follows: The first line of defense consists of each LOB, Treasury and CIO, and certain Other Corporate initiatives, including their aligned Operations, Technology and Control Management. The first line of defense owns the identification of risks within their respective organizations and the design and execution of controls to manage those risks. Responsibilities also include adherence to applicable laws, rules and regulations and implementation of the risk Management’s discussion and analysis 86 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K The Firm's risk governance and oversight functions align to: Drivers of Risks Factors that cause a risk to exist Types of Risks categories by which risks manifest themselves Impacts of Risks consequences of risks, both quantitative and qualitative governance framework established by IRM, which may include policies, standards, limits, thresholds and controls. The second line of defense is the IRM function, which is separate from the first line of defense and is responsible for independently measuring risk, as well as assessing and challenging the risk management practices of the first line of defense. IRM is also responsible for the identification of risks within its respective organization, adherence to applicable laws, rules and regulations and for the development and implementation of policies and standards with respect to its own processes. The third line of defense is Internal Audit, an independent function that provides objective assessment of the adequacy and effectiveness of Firmwide processes, controls, governance and risk management. The Internal Audit function is headed by the General Auditor, who reports to the Audit Committee and administratively to the CEO. In addition, there are other functions that contribute to the Firmwide control environment but are not considered part of a particular line of defense, including Finance, Human Resources and Legal. These other functions are responsible for the identification of risks within their respective organizations, adherence to applicable laws, rules and regulations and implementation of the risk governance framework established by IRM. Risk identification and ownership The LOBs and Corporate own the identification of risks within their respective organizations, as well as the design and execution of controls, including IRM-specified controls, to manage those risks. To support this activity, the Firm has a risk identification framework designed to facilitate each LOB and Corporate’s responsibility to identify material risks inherent to the Firm’s businesses and operational activities, catalog them in a central repository and review material risks on a regular basis. The IRM function reviews and challenges the LOB and Corporate’s identified risks, maintains the central repository and provides the consolidated Firmwide results to the Firmwide Risk Committee (“FRC”) and the Board Risk Committee. Risk appetite The Firm’s overall appetite for risk is governed by “Risk Appetite” frameworks for quantitative and qualitative risks. The Firm’s risk appetite is periodically set and approved by senior management (including the CEO and CRO) and approved by the Board Risk Committee. Quantitative and qualitative risks are assessed to monitor and measure the Firm’s capacity to take risk consistent with its stated risk appetite. Risk appetite results are reported to the Board Risk Committee. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K 87 Risk governance and oversight structure The independent status of the IRM function is supported by a risk governance and oversight structure that provides channels for the escalation of risks and issues to senior management, the FRC, and the Board of Directors, as appropriate. The chart below illustrates the principal standing committees of the Board of Directors and key senior management-level committees in the Firm’s risk governance and oversight structure. In addition, there are other committees, forums and channels of escalation that support the oversight of risk that are not shown in the chart below or described in this Form 10-K. The Firm’s Operating Committee, which consists of the Firm’s CEO, CRO, Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), General Counsel, CEOs of the LOBs and other senior executives, is accountable to and may refer matters to the Firm’s Board of Directors. The Operating Committee and certain other members of senior management are responsible for escalating to the Board the information necessary to facilitate the Board’s exercise of its duties. Board oversight The Firm’s Board of Directors actively oversees the business and affairs of the Firm. This includes monitoring the Firm’s financial performance and condition and reviewing the strategic objectives and plans of the Firm. The Board carries out a significant portion of its oversight responsibilities through its principal standing committees, each of which consists solely of independent members of the Board. The Board Risk Committee is the principal committee that oversees risk matters. The Audit Committee oversees the control environment, and the Compensation & Management Development Committee oversees compensation and other management-related matters. Each committee of the Board oversees reputation risks, conduct risks, and environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) matters within its scope of responsibility. The JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Board of Directors is responsible for the oversight of management of the bank, which it discharges both acting directly and through the principal standing committees of the Firm’s Board of Directors. Risk and control oversight on behalf of JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A. is primarily the responsibility of the Board Risk Committee and the Audit Committee, respectively, and, with respect to compensation and other management- related matters, the Compensation & Management Development Committee. The Board Risk Committee assists the Board in its oversight of management’s responsibility to implement a global risk management framework reasonably designed to identify, assess and manage the Firm’s risks. The Board Risk Committee’s responsibilities include approval of applicable primary risk policies and review of certain associated frameworks, analysis and reporting established by management. Breaches in risk appetite and parameters, issues that may have a material adverse impact on the Firm, including capital and liquidity issues, and other significant risk-related matters are escalated to the Board Risk Committee, as appropriate. The Audit Committee assists the Board in its oversight of management’s responsibility to ensure that there is an effective system of controls reasonably designed to safeguard the Firm’s assets and income, ensure the integrity of the Firm’s financial statements, and maintain compliance with the Firm’s ethical standards, policies, plans and procedures, and with laws, rules and regulations. It also assists the Board in its oversight of the qualifications, independence and performance of the Firm’s independent registered public accounting firm, and of the performance of the Firm’s Internal Audit function.

The Committee reviews the performance of Operating Committee members against their goals, and approves their compensation awards. In addition, the CEO’s award is subject to ratification by the independent directors of the Board. The CMDC also reviews the development of and succession for key executives. As part of the Board’s role of reinforcing, demonstrating and communicating the “tone at the top,” the CMDC oversees the Firm’s culture, including reviewing updates from management regarding significant conduct issues and any related actions with respect to employees, including compensation actions. The Public Responsibility Committee oversees and reviews the Firm's positions and practices on public responsibility matters such as community investment, fair lending, sustainability, consumer practices and other public policy issues that reflect the Firm's values and character and could impact the Firm's reputation among its stakeholders. The Committee also provides guidance on these matters to management and the Board, as appropriate. The Corporate Governance & Nominating Committee exercises general oversight with respect to the governance of the Board of Directors. It reviews the qualifications of and recommends to the Board proposed nominees for election to the Board. The Committee evaluates and recommends to the Board corporate governance practices applicable to the Firm. It also reviews the framework for assessing the Board’s performance and self-evaluation. Management oversight The Firm’s senior management-level committees that are primarily responsible for key risk-related functions include: The Firmwide Risk Committee (“FRC”) is the Firm’s highest management-level risk committee. It oversees the risks inherent in the Firm’s business and provides a forum for discussion of topics and issues that are raised or escalated by its members and other committees. The Firmwide Control Committee (“FCC”) is an escalation committee for senior management to review and discuss the Firmwide compliance and operational risk environment including identified issues, compliance and operational risk metrics and significant events that have been escalated. Line of Business and Regional Risk Committees are responsible for overseeing the governance, limits, and controls that have been established within the scope of their respective activities. These committees review the ways in which the particular LOB or the businesses operating in a particular region could be exposed to adverse outcomes, with a focus on identifying, accepting, escalating and/or requiring remediation of matters brought to these committees. Line of Business and Corporate Function Control Committees oversee the risk and control environment of their respective business or function, inclusive of Operational Risk, Compliance and Conduct Risks. As part of that mandate, they are responsible for reviewing indicators of elevated or emerging risks and other data that may impact the level of compliance and operational risk in a business or function, addressing key compliance and operational risk issues, with an emphasis on processes with control concerns and overseeing control remediation. The Asset and Liability Committee (“ALCO”) is responsible for overseeing the Firm’s asset and liability management (“ALM”), including the activities and frameworks supporting management of the balance sheet, liquidity risk, interest rate risk, and capital risk. The Firmwide Valuation Governance Forum (“VGF”) is composed of senior finance and risk executives and is responsible for overseeing the management of risks arising from valuation activities conducted across the Firm. Risk governance and oversight functions The Firm manages its risk through risk governance and oversight functions. The scope of a particular function or business activity may include one or more drivers, types and/or impacts of risk. For example, Country Risk Management oversees country risk which may be a driver of risk or an aggregation of exposures that could give rise to multiple risk types such as credit or market risk. The following sections discuss the risk governance and oversight functions that have been established to manage the risks inherent in the Firm’s business activities.

Management and oversight The Operating Committee, together with the senior leadership of each LOB and Corporate, are responsible for managing the Firm’s most significant strategic risks. IRM engages regularly in strategic business discussions and decision-making, including participation in relevant business reviews and senior management meetings, risk and control committees and other relevant governance forums, and review of acquisitions and new business initiatives. The Board of Directors oversees management’s strategic decisions, and the Board Risk Committee oversees IRM and the Firm’s risk governance framework. In the process of developing business plans and strategic initiatives, LOB and Corporate senior management identify the associated risks that are incorporated into the Firmwide Risk Identification framework and their impact on risk appetite. In addition, IRM conducts a qualitative assessment of the LOB and Corporate strategic initiatives to assess their impact on the risk profile of the Firm. The Firm’s strategic planning process, which includes the development of the Firm’s strategic plan and other strategic initiatives, is one component of managing the Firm’s strategic risk. The strategic plan outlines the Firm’s strategic framework and initiatives, and includes components such as budget, risk appetite, capital, earnings and asset-liability management objectives. Guided by the Firm’s Business Principles, the Operating Committee and senior management teams in each LOB and Corporate review and update the strategic plan periodically, including evaluating the strategic framework and performance against prior-year initiatives, assessing the operating environment, refining existing strategies and developing new strategies. The Firm’s strategic plan, together with IRM’s assessment, are provided to the Board as part of its review and approval of the Firm’s strategic plan, and the plan is also reflected in the Firm's budget. The Firm’s balance sheet strategy, which focuses on risk- adjusted returns, strong capital and robust liquidity, is also a component in the management of strategic risk. Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 91-101 for further information on capital risk. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 102–109 for further information on liquidity risk. Refer to Reputation Risk Management on page 110 for further information on reputation risk. Management’s discussion and analysis 90 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT Capital risk is the risk that the Firm has an insufficient level or composition of capital to support the Firm’s business activities and associated risks during normal economic environments and under stressed conditions. A strong capital position is essential to the Firm’s business strategy and competitive position. Maintaining a strong balance sheet to manage through economic volatility is a strategic imperative of the Firm’s Board of Directors, CEO and Operating Committee. The Firm’s “fortress balance sheet” philosophy focuses on risk-adjusted returns, strong capital and robust liquidity. The Firm’s capital risk management strategy focuses on maintaining long-term stability to enable the Firm to build and invest in market- leading businesses, including in highly stressed environments. Senior management considers the implications on the Firm’s capital prior to making significant decisions that could impact future business activities. In addition to considering the Firm’s earnings outlook, senior management evaluates all sources and uses of capital with a view to ensuring the Firm’s capital strength. Capital risk management The Firm has a Capital Risk Management function whose primary objective is to provide independent oversight of capital risk across the Firm. Capital Risk Management’s responsibilities include: • Defining, monitoring and reporting capital risk metrics; • Establishing, calibrating and monitoring capital risk limits and indicators, including capital risk appetite; • Developing processes to classify, monitor and report capital limit breaches; • Performing assessments of the Firm’s capital management activities, including changes made to the Contingency Capital Plan described below; and • Conducting assessments of the Firm's regulatory capital framework intended to ensure compliance with applicable regulatory capital rules. Capital management Treasury and CIO is responsible for capital management. The primary objectives of the Firm’s capital management are to: • Maintain sufficient capital in order to continue to build and invest in the Firm’s businesses through normal economic cycles and in stressed environments; • Retain flexibility to take advantage of future investment opportunities; • Promote the Parent Company’s ability to serve as a source of strength to its subsidiaries; • Ensure the Firm operates above the minimum regulatory capital ratios as well as maintain “well-capitalized” status for the Firm and its principal insured depository institution (“IDI”) subsidiary, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. at all times under applicable regulatory capital requirements; • Meet capital distribution objectives; and • Maintain sufficient capital resources to operate throughout a resolution period in accordance with the Firm’s preferred resolution strategy. The Firm addresses these objectives through: • Establishing internal minimum capital requirements and maintaining a strong capital governance framework. The internal minimum capital levels consider the Firm’s regulatory capital requirements as well as an internal assessment of capital adequacy, in normal economic cycles and in stress events; • Retaining flexibility in order to react to a range of potential events; and • Regularly monitoring the Firm’s capital position and following prescribed escalation protocols, both at the Firm and material legal entity levels. Governance Committees responsible for overseeing the Firm’s capital management include the Capital Governance Committee, the Firmwide ALCO as well as regional ALCOs, and the CIO, Treasury and Corporate (“CTC”) Risk Committee. In addition, the Board Risk Committee periodically reviews the Firm’s capital risk tolerance. Refer to Firmwide Risk Management on pages 86–89 for additional discussion of the Firmwide ALCO and other risk-related committees. Capital planning and stress testing Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review The Federal Reserve requires the Firm, as a large Bank Holding Company (“BHC”), to submit at least annually a capital plan that has been reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors. The Federal Reserve uses Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (“CCAR”) and other stress testing processes to assess whether large BHCs, such as the Firm, have sufficient capital during periods of economic and financial stress, and have robust, forward- looking capital assessment and planning processes in place that address each BHC’s unique risks to enable it to absorb losses under certain stress scenarios. Through CCAR, the Federal Reserve evaluates each BHC’s capital adequacy and internal capital adequacy assessment processes (“ICAAP”), as well as its plans to make capital distributions, such as dividend payments or stock repurchases. The Federal Reserve uses results under the severely adverse scenario from its supervisory stress test to determine each firm’s Stress Capital Buffer (“SCB”) requirement for the coming year. The Firm's current SCB requirement is 2.9%, and will remain in effect until September 30, 2024. The Firm’s Standardized CET1 capital ratio requirement, including regulatory buffers, was 11.4% as of December 31, 2023. Refer to Capital actions on page 99 for information on actions taken by the Firm’s Board of Directors. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K 91 Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process Annually, the Firm prepares the ICAAP, which informs the Board of Directors of the ongoing assessment of the Firm’s processes for managing the sources and uses of capital as well as compliance with supervisory expectations for capital planning and capital adequacy. The Firm’s ICAAP integrates stress testing protocols with capital planning. The Firm’s Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing and approving the capital planning framework. Stress testing assesses the potential impact of alternative economic and business scenarios on the Firm’s earnings and capital. Economic scenarios, and the parameters underlying those scenarios, are defined centrally and applied uniformly across the businesses. These scenarios are articulated in terms of macroeconomic factors, which are key drivers of business results; global market shocks, which generate short-term but severe trading losses; and idiosyncratic operational risk events. The scenarios are intended to capture and stress key vulnerabilities and idiosyncratic risks facing the Firm. In addition to CCAR and other periodic stress testing, management also considers tailored stress scenarios and sensitivity analyses, as necessary. Contingency Capital Plan The Firm’s Contingency Capital Plan establishes the capital management framework for the Firm and specifies the principles underlying the Firm’s approach towards capital management in normal economic conditions and in stressed environments. The Contingency Capital Plan defines how the Firm calibrates its targeted capital levels and meets minimum capital requirements, monitors the ongoing appropriateness of planned capital distributions, and sets out the capital contingency actions that are expected to be taken or considered at various levels of capital depletion during a period of stress. Regulatory capital The Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements, including well-capitalized standards, for the Firm as a consolidated financial holding company. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (\"OCC\") establishes similar minimum capital requirements and standards for the Firm’s principal IDI subsidiary, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The U.S. capital requirements generally follow the Capital Accord of the Basel Committee, as amended from time to time. Basel III Overview The capital rules under Basel III establish minimum capital ratios and overall capital adequacy standards for large and internationally active U.S. BHCs and banks, including the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The minimum amount of regulatory capital that must be held by BHCs and banks is determined by calculating RWA, which are on-balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet exposures, weighted according to risk. Under the rules currently in effect, two comprehensive approaches are prescribed for calculating RWA: a standardized approach (“Basel III Standardized”), and an advanced approach (“Basel III Advanced”). For each of these risk-based capital ratios, the capital adequacy of the Firm is evaluated against the lower of the Standardized or Advanced approaches compared to their respective regulatory capital ratio requirements. In July 2023, the Federal Reserve, the OCC and the FDIC released a proposal to amend the risk-based capital framework, entitled \"Regulatory capital rule: Amendments applicable to large banking organizations and to banking organizations with significant trading activity,\" which is referred to in this Form 10-K as “U.S. Basel III proposal”. Under the proposal, changes to the framework would include replacement of the Advanced approach with an expanded risk-based approach, which would not permit the use of internal models for the calculation of RWA, other than for market risk. In addition, the stress capital buffer requirement would be applicable to both the expanded risk- based approach and the Standardized approach. The proposal would significantly revise risk-based capital requirements for all banks with assets of $100 billion or more, including the Firm and other U.S. GSIBs. The proposed effective date is July 1, 2025, with a three-year transition period applicable to the expanded risk-based approach. Based on the Firm's understanding of the proposal, as applied to its Consolidated balance sheets as of June 30, 2023 (the reference date for a special data collection exercise conducted by the Federal Reserve), the estimated impact at the end of the transition period would increase RWA by approximately 30%, which would result in an approximately 25% increase to CET1 capital necessary to meet the Firm’s CET1 ratio requirement, all else equal. These estimates do not reflect any actions that the Firm may take to mitigate the impact of the rule as currently proposed. Pending the finalization of the U.S. Basel III proposal, the Firm expects that it will continue to build capital above the current levels, and therefore the CET1 target of 13.5% previously set by the Firm (which was with respect to the current Standardized RWA measure) is no longer meaningful. The Firm's quarterly capital ratios will vary dependent on market conditions and other factors. Under the requirements of the U.S. Basel III proposal, the new expanded risk-based approach, when fully phased-in, would be the Firm’s binding constraint. The current Basel III rules establish capital requirements for calculating credit risk RWA and market risk RWA, and in the case of Basel III Advanced, operational risk RWA. Key differences in the calculation of credit risk RWA between the Standardized and Advanced approaches are that for Basel III Advanced, credit risk RWA is based on risk-sensitive approaches which largely rely on the use of internal credit models and parameters, whereas for Basel III Standardized, credit risk RWA is generally based on supervisory risk- weightings which vary primarily by counterparty type and asset class. Market risk RWA is generally calculated consistently between Basel III Standardized and Basel III Advanced. In addition to the RWA calculated under these approaches, the Firm may supplement such amounts to Management’s discussion and analysis 92 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K incorporate management judgment and feedback from its regulators. As of December 31, 2023, the Advanced Total Capital ratio became the most binding constraint for the Firm’s Basel III risk-based ratios, primarily reflecting the reduction in the Stress Capital Buffer requirement. However, as of December 31, 2023, with respect to the CET1 and Tier 1 risk-based ratios, the Standardized ratios are more binding than the Advanced ratios. Basel III also includes a requirement for Advanced Approaches banking organizations, including the Firm, to calculate its SLR. As of the fourth quarter of 2023, the Firm’s SLR became more binding than the Basel III risk- based ratios, primarily reflecting the reduction in the Stress Capital Buffer requirement. With the increase in the GSIB surcharge in the first quarter of 2024, the Firm expects the risk-based ratios to revert to being more binding than the SLR. Refer to page 95 for additional information on GSIB surcharge and page 98 for additional information on SLR. Other Key Regulatory Developments GSIB Surcharge In July 2023, the Federal Reserve also released a proposal to amend the calculation of the GSIB surcharge. If adopted as proposed, these amendments would require the Firm to assess its GSIB surcharge on an annual basis, using the average of the quarterly surcharge calculations throughout the calendar year, with daily averaging required for certain measures within the surcharge calculation. Surcharge increments would be reduced from 50 bps to 10 bps and there would also be other technical amendments to the Method 2 calculation. The proposed amendments would revise risk-based capital requirements for the Firm and other U.S. GSIBs, and would become effective two calendar quarters after the adoption of the final rule. Refer to Risk- based Capital Regulatory Requirements on pages 94-95 for further information on the GSIB surcharge. TLAC and Eligible LTD Requirements In August 2023, the Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the OCC released a proposal to expand the eligible long-term debt (\"eligible LTD\") and clean holding company requirements under the existing total loss-absorbing capacity (\"TLAC\") rule to apply to non-GSIB banks with $100 billion or more in total consolidated assets. While U.S. GSIBs are already subject to these requirements, the proposal would reduce the amount of LTD with remaining maturities of less than two years that count towards a U.S. GSIB's TLAC requirement. The proposal would also expand the existing capital deduction framework for LTD issued by GSIBs to include LTD issued by non-GSIB banks subject to the LTD requirements. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K 93 Risk-based Capital Regulatory Requirements The following chart presents the Firm’s Basel III CET1 capital ratio requirements under the Basel III rules currently in effect. All banking institutions are currently required to have a minimum CET1 capital ratio of 4.5% of risk-weighted assets. Certain banking organizations, including the Firm, are required to hold additional levels of capital to serve as a “capital conservation buffer”. The capital conservation buffer incorporates a GSIB surcharge, a discretionary countercyclical capital buffer and a fixed capital conservation buffer of 2.5% for Advanced regulatory capital requirements, as well as a variable SCB requirement, floored at 2.5%, for Standardized regulatory capital requirements. Under the Federal Reserve’s GSIB rule, the Firm is required to assess its GSIB surcharge on an annual basis under two separately prescribed methods based on data for the previous fiscal year-end, and is subject to the higher of the two. “Method 1” reflects the GSIB surcharge as prescribed by the Basel Committee’s assessment methodology, and is calculated by the Financial Stability Board (“FSB”) across five criteria: size, cross-jurisdictional activity, interconnectedness, complexity and substitutability. “Method 2”, calculated by the Firm, modifies the Method 1 requirements to include a measure of short-term wholesale funding in place of substitutability, and introduces a GSIB score “multiplication factor”.

The Firm’s Method 2 surcharge calculated using data as of December 31, 2021 is 4.5% (up from 4.0%), which became effective January 1, 2024. The Firm’s estimated Method 2 surcharge calculated using data as of December 31, 2022 is 4.5%. Accordingly, based on the GSIB rule currently in effect, the Firm’s effective GSIB surcharge increased to 4.5% on January 1, 2024. The U.S. federal regulatory capital standards include a framework for setting a discretionary countercyclical capital buffer taking into account the macro financial environment in which large, internationally active banks function. As of December 31, 2023, the U.S. countercyclical capital buffer remained at 0%. The Federal Reserve will continue to review the buffer at least annually. The buffer can be increased if the Federal Reserve, FDIC and OCC determine that systemic risks are meaningfully above normal and can be calibrated up to an additional 2.5% of RWA subject to a 12-month implementation period. Failure to maintain regulatory capital equal to or in excess of the risk-based regulatory capital minimum plus the capital conservation buffer (inclusive of the GSIB surcharge) and any countercyclical buffer will result in limitations to the amount of capital that the Firm may distribute, such as through dividends and common share repurchases, as well as on discretionary bonus payments for certain executive officers. Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity The Federal Reserve’s TLAC rule requires the U.S. GSIB top- tier holding companies, including the Firm, to maintain minimum levels of external TLAC and eligible LTD. Refer to TLAC on page 100 for additional information. Leverage-based Capital Regulatory Requirements Supplementary leverage ratio Banking organizations subject to the Basel III Advanced approach are currently required to have a minimum SLR of 3.0%. Certain banking organizations, including the Firm, are also required to hold an additional 2.0% leverage buffer. The SLR is defined as Tier 1 capital under Basel III divided by the Firm’s total leverage exposure. Total leverage exposure is calculated by taking the Firm’s total average on-balance sheet assets, less amounts permitted to be deducted for Tier 1 capital, and adding certain off- balance sheet exposures, as defined in regulatory capital rules. Refer to SLR on page 98 for additional information. Failure to maintain an SLR equal to or greater than the regulatory requirement will result in limitations on the amount of capital that the Firm may distribute such as through dividends and common share repurchases, as well as on discretionary bonus payments for certain executive officers. Other regulatory capital In addition to meeting the capital ratio requirements of Basel III, the Firm and its principal IDI subsidiary, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. must also maintain minimum capital and leverage ratios in order to be “well-capitalized” under the regulations issued by the Federal Reserve and the Prompt Corrective Action requirements of the FDIC Improvement Act, respectively. Refer to Note 27 for additional information. Additional information regarding the Firm’s capital ratios, as well as the U.S. federal regulatory capital standards to which the Firm is subject, is presented in Note 27.

Line of business equity Each business segment is allocated capital by taking into consideration a variety of factors including capital levels of similarly rated peers and applicable regulatory capital requirements. ROE is measured and internal targets for expected returns are established as key measures of a business segment’s performance. The Firm’s current allocation methodology incorporates Basel III Standardized RWA and the GSIB surcharge, both under rules currently in effect, as well as a simulation of capital in a severe stress environment. At least annually, the assumptions, judgments and methodologies used to allocate capital are reassessed and, as a result, the capital allocated to the LOBs may change. As of January 1, 2024, changes to the Firm’s line of business capital allocations are primarily a result of updates to the Firm’s current capital requirements and changes in RWA for each LOB under rules currently in effect. In addition, the capital that the Firm has accumulated to meet the increased requirements of the U.S. Basel III proposal has generally been retained in Corporate.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K 101 LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT Liquidity risk is the risk that the Firm will be unable to meet its cash and collateral needs as they arise or that it does not have the appropriate amount, composition and tenor of funding and liquidity to support its assets and liabilities. Liquidity risk management The Firm has a Liquidity Risk Management (“LRM”) function whose primary objective is to provide independent oversight of liquidity risk across the Firm. Liquidity Risk Management’s responsibilities include: • Defining, monitoring and reporting liquidity risk metrics; • Independently establishing and monitoring limits and indicators, including liquidity risk appetite; • Developing a process to classify, monitor and report limit breaches; • Performing an independent review of liquidity risk management processes to evaluate their adequacy and effectiveness; • Monitoring and reporting internal Firmwide and legal entity liquidity stress tests, regulatory defined metrics, as well as liquidity positions, balance sheet variances and funding activities; and • Approving or escalating for review new or updated liquidity stress assumptions. Liquidity management Treasury and CIO is responsible for liquidity management. The primary objectives of the Firm’s liquidity management are to: • Ensure that the Firm’s core businesses and material legal entities are able to operate in support of client needs and meet contractual and contingent financial obligations through normal economic cycles as well as during stress events, and • Manage an optimal funding mix and availability of liquidity sources. The Firm addresses these objectives through: • Analyzing and understanding the liquidity characteristics of the assets and liabilities of the Firm, LOBs, legal entities, as well as currencies, taking into account legal, regulatory, and operational restrictions; • Developing internal liquidity stress testing assumptions; • Defining and monitoring Firmwide and legal entity- specific liquidity strategies, policies, reporting and contingency funding plans; • Managing liquidity within the Firm’s approved liquidity risk appetite tolerances and limits; • Managing compliance with regulatory requirements related to funding and liquidity risk; and • Setting FTP in accordance with underlying liquidity characteristics of balance sheet assets and liabilities as well as certain off-balance sheet items. As part of the Firm’s overall liquidity management strategy, the Firm manages liquidity and funding using a centralized, global approach designed to: • Optimize liquidity sources and uses; • Monitor exposures; • Identify constraints on the transfer of liquidity between the Firm’s legal entities; and • Maintain the appropriate amount of surplus liquidity at a Firmwide and legal entity level, where relevant. Governance Committees responsible for liquidity governance include the Firmwide ALCO, as well as regional ALCOs, the Treasurer Committee, and the CTC Risk Committee. In addition, the Board Risk Committee reviews and recommends to the Board of Directors, for approval, the Firm’s liquidity risk tolerances, liquidity strategy, and liquidity policy. Refer to Firmwide Risk Management on pages 86–89 for further discussion of ALCO and other risk-related committees. Internal stress testing The Firm conducts internal liquidity stress testing that is intended to ensure that the Firm and its material legal entities have sufficient liquidity under a variety of adverse scenarios, including scenarios analyzed as part of the Firm’s resolution and recovery planning. Internal stress tests are produced on a regular basis, and other stress tests are performed in response to specific market events or concerns. Liquidity stress tests assume all of the Firm’s contractual financial obligations are met and take into consideration: • Varying levels of access to unsecured and secured funding markets; • Estimated non-contractual and contingent cash outflows; • Credit rating downgrades; • Collateral haircuts; and • Potential impediments to the availability and transferability of liquidity between jurisdictions and material legal entities such as regulatory, legal or other restrictions. Liquidity outflows are modeled across a range of time horizons and currency dimensions and contemplate both market and idiosyncratic stresses. Results of stress tests are considered in the formulation of the Firm’s funding plan and assessment of its liquidity position. The Parent Company acts as a source of funding for the Firm through equity and long-term debt issuances, and its intermediate holding company, JPMorgan Chase Holdings LLC (the “IHC”), provides funding to support the ongoing operations of the Parent Company and its subsidiaries. The Firm maintains liquidity at the Parent Company, the IHC, and operating subsidiaries at levels sufficient to comply with liquidity risk tolerances and minimum liquidity requirements, and to manage through Management’s discussion and analysis 102 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K periods of stress when access to normal funding sources may be disrupted. Contingency funding plan The Firm’s Contingency Funding Plan (“CFP”) sets out the strategies for addressing and managing liquidity resource needs during a liquidity stress event and incorporates liquidity risk limits, indicators and risk appetite tolerances. The CFP also identifies the alternative contingent funding and liquidity resources available to the Firm and its legal entities in a period of stress. LCR and HQLA The LCR rule requires that the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. maintain an amount of eligible HQLA that is sufficient to meet their respective estimated total net cash outflows over a prospective 30 calendar-day period of significant stress. Eligible HQLA, for purposes of calculating the LCR, is the amount of unencumbered HQLA that satisfy certain operational considerations as defined in the LCR rule. HQLA primarily consist of cash and certain high-quality liquid securities as defined in the LCR rule. Under the LCR rule, the amount of eligible HQLA held by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that is in excess of its stand- alone 100% minimum LCR requirement, and that is not transferable to non-bank affiliates, must be excluded from the Firm’s reported eligible HQLA. Estimated net cash outflows are based on standardized stress outflow and inflow rates prescribed in the LCR rule, which are applied to the balances of the Firm’s assets, sources of funds, and obligations. The LCR for both the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is required to be a minimum of 100%. The following table summarizes the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s average LCR for the three months ended D ecember 31, 2023, September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 based on the Firm’s interpretation of the LCR framework.

JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s average LCR increased during the three months ended December 31, 2023, compa red with the three months ended September 30, 2023, driven by CIB market activities, partially offset by loan growth. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s average LCR for the three months ended December 31, 2023 decreased compared with the three months ended December 31, 2022, reflecting a decrease in JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s HQLA as a result of a reduction in cash due to a decline in average deposits and l oan growth, as well as the impact of First Republic and lower market values of HQLA-eligible investment securities. These impacts were partially offset by CIB markets activities. Refer to Note 10 and Note 34 for additional information on the Firm's investment securities portfolio and the First Republic acquisition. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K 103 Three months endedThree months ended Actions by the Federal Reserve have impacted depositor behavior, resulting in reductions to system-wide deposits, including those held by the Firm. Each of the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s average LCR may fluctuate from period to period due to changes in their respective eligible HQLA and estimated net cash outflows as a result of ongoing business activity and from the continued impacts of Federal Reserve actions as well as other factors. Refer to the Firm’s U.S. LCR Disclosure reports, which are available on the Firm’s website, for a further discussion of the Firm’s LCR. Liquidity sources In addition to the assets reported in the Firm’s eligible HQLA discussed above, the Firm had unencumbered marketable securities, such as equity and debt securities, that the Firm believes would be available to raise liquidity. This includes excess eligible HQLA securities at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that are not transferable to non-bank affiliates. The fair value of these securities was approximately $649 billion and $694 billion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, although the amount of liquidity that could be raised at any particular time would be dependent on prevailing market conditions. The decrease compared to December 31, 2022, was driven by a reduction in excess eligible HQLA securities at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., partially offset by an increase in unencumbered AFS securities. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Firm had approximately $1.4 trillion of available cash and securities comprised of eligible end-of-period HQLA, excluding the impact of regulatory haircuts of $798.0 billion and $735.5 billion, respectively, and unencumbered marketable securities with a fair value of approximately $649 billion and $694 billion, respectively. The Firm also had available borrowing capacity at the Federal Home Loan Banks (“FHLBs”) and the discount window at the Federal Reserve Banks as a result of collateral pledged by the Firm to such banks of approximately $340 billion and $323 billion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. This borrowing capacity excludes the benefit of cash and securities reported in the Firm’s eligible HQLA or other unencumbered securities that are currently pledged at the Federal Reserve Banks discount window and other central banks. Available borrowing capacity increased from December 31, 2022 primarily due to a higher amount of wholesale loans pledged at the Federal Reserve Banks. Although available, the Firm does not view this borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve Banks discount window and the other central banks as a primary source of liquidity. NSFR The net stable funding ratio (“NSFR”) is a liquidity requirement for large banking organizations that is intended to measure the adequacy of “available” stable funding that is sufficient to meet their “required” amounts of stable funding over a one-year horizon. For the three months ended December 31, 2023, both the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. were compliant with the 100% minimum NSFR requirement, based on the Firm’s interpretation of the final rule. Refer to the Firm's U.S. NSFR Disclosure report covering December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023 on the Firm’s website for additional information. Management’s discussion and analysis 104 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K Funding Sources of funds Management believes that the Firm’s unsecured and secured funding capacity is sufficient to meet its on- and off-balance sheet obligations, which includes both short- and long-term cash requirements. The Firm funds its global balance sheet through diverse sources of funding including stable deposits, secured and unsecured funding in the capital markets and stockholders’ equity. Deposits are the primary funding source for JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Additionally, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. may access funding through short- or long-term secured borrowings, the issuance of unsecured long-term debt, or from borrowings from the IHC. The Firm’s non-bank subsidiaries are primarily funded from long-term unsecured borrowings and short-term secured borrowings which are primarily securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements. Excess funding is invested by Treasury and CIO in the Firm’s investment securities portfolio or deployed in cash or other short-term liquid investments based on their interest rate and liquidity risk characteristics. Refer to Note 28 for additional information on off–balance sheet obligations. Deposits The table below summarizes, by LOB and Corporate, the period-end and average deposit balances as of and for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. As of or for the year ended December 31, Average (in millions) 2023 2022 2023 2022 Consumer & Community Banking $ 1,094,738 $ 1,131,611 $ 1,126,552 $ 1,162,680 Corporate & Investment Bank 777,638 689,893 728,537 739,700 Commercial Banking 273,254 271,342 267,758 294,180 Asset & Wealth Management 233,232 233,130 216,178 261,489 Corporate 21,826 14,203 20,042 9,866 Total Firm $ 2,400,688 $ 2,340,179 $ 2,359,067 $ 2,467,915 The Firm believes that deposits provide a stable source of funding and reduce the Firm’s reliance on the wholesale funding markets. A significant portion of the Firm’s deposits are consumer deposits and wholesale operating deposits, which are both considered to be stable sources of liquidity. Wholesale operating deposits are generally considered to be stable sources of liquidity because they are generated from customers that maintain operating service relationships with the Firm. The Firm believes that average deposit balances are generally more representative of deposit trends than period- end deposit balances. However, during periods of market disruption, average deposit trends may be impacted. Average deposits were lower for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, reflecting the net impact of: • lower balances in AWM due to continued migration into higher-yielding investments driven by the higher interest rate environment, partially offset by growth from new and existing customers as a result of new product offerings and the impact of First Republic, • a decline in CCB reflecting higher customer spending, largely offset by the impact of First Republic, • a decrease in CB due to continued deposit attrition as clients seek higher-yielding investments, partially offset by the retention of inflows associated with disruptions in the market in the first quarter of 2023, • a decline in CIB due to deposit attrition, including actions taken to reduce certain deposits, predominantly offset by net issuances of structured notes as a result of client demand, and • growth in Corporate related to the Firm's international consumer initiatives. Period-end deposits increased from December 31, 2022, reflecting the net impact of: • higher balances in CIB due to net issuances of structured notes as a result of client demand, as well as deposit inflows from client-driven activities in Payments and Securities Services, partially offset by deposit attrition, including actions taken to reduce certain deposits, • growth in Corporate related to the Firm's international consumer initiatives, • lower balances in CCB reflecting higher customer spending, • a decline in AWM due to continued migration into higher- yielding investments driven by the higher interest rate environment, predominantly offset by growth from new and existing customers as a result of new product offerings, and • a decrease in CB due to continued deposit attrition as clients seek higher-yielding investments, predominantly offset by the retention of inflows associated with disruptions in the market in the first quarter of 2023. The net increase also included $61 billion of deposits associated with First Republic, primarily reflected in CCB, AWM and CB.

Refer to the Firm’s Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis and the Business Segment Results on pages 58–60 and pages 65–85, respectively, for further information on deposit and liability balance trends. Refer to Note 3 for further information on structured notes. Certain deposits are covered by insurance protection that provides additional funding stability and results in a benefit to the LCR. Deposit insurance protection may be available to depositors in the countries in which the deposits are placed. For example, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) provides deposit insurance protection for deposits placed in a U.S. depository institution. At D ecember 31, 2023 and 2022, the Firmwide estimated uninsured deposits were $1,331.9 billion and $1,383.7 billion, respectively, primarily reflecting wholesale operating deposits. Total uninsured deposits include time deposits. The table below presents an estimate of uninsured U.S. and non-U.S. time deposits, and their remaining maturities. The Firm’s estimates of its uninsured U.S. time deposits are based on data that the Firm calculates periodically under applicable FDIC regulations. For purposes of this presentation, all non- U.S. time deposits are deemed to be uninsured.

(g) As of December 31, 2023, included short-term and long-term FHLB advances of $500 million and $23.2 billion, respectively, associated with First Republic. Refer to Note 34 for additional information. Short-term funding The Firm’s sources of short-term secured funding primarily consist of securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase. These instruments are secured predominantly by high-quality securities collateral, including government- issued debt and U.S. GSE and government agency MBS. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase increased at December 31, 2023, compared with December 31, 2022, reflecting the impact of a lower level of netting on reduced repurchase activity. The balances associated with securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase fluctuate over time due to investment and financing activities of clients, the Firm’s demand for financing, the ongoing management of the mix of the Firm’s liabilities, including its secured and unsecured financing (for both the investment securities and market- making portfolios), and other market and portfolio factors. The Firm’s sources of short-term unsecured funding primarily consist of issuances of wholesale commercial paper and other borrowed funds. The increase in period-end commercial paper and the decrease in average balances for the year ended D ecember 31, 2023 compared to the respective prior year periods were due to changes in net issuance levels primarily for short-term liquidity management. The decrease in average secured other borrowed funds for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the prior year period was primarily due to lower financing of Markets activities. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K 107 Average Long-term funding and issuance Long-term funding provides an additional source of stable funding and liquidity for the Firm. The Firm’s long-term funding plan is driven primarily by expected client activity, liquidity considerations and regulatory requirements, including TLAC. Long-term funding objectives include maintaining diversification, maximizing market access and optimizing funding costs. The Firm evaluates various funding markets, tenors and currencies in creating its optimal long-term funding plan. The significant majority of the Firm’s total outstanding long-term debt has been issued by the Parent Company to provide flexibility in support of the funding needs of both bank and non-bank subsidiaries. The Parent Company advances substantially all net funding proceeds to its subsidiary, the IHC. The IHC does not issue debt to external counterparties. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the increase in period-end structured notes compared to the prior year period was attributable to net issuances of structured notes in Markets due to client demand and an increase in fair value. The following table summarizes long-term unsecured issuance and maturities or redemptions for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. Refer to Note 20 for additional information on the IHC and long-term debt.

Refer to Note 14 for a further description of client-driven loan securitizations. Management’s discussion and analysis 108 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K Parent Company Subsidiaries Issuance Maturities/Redemptions Credit ratings The cost and availability of financing are influenced by credit ratings. Reductions in these ratings could have an adverse effect on the Firm’s access to liquidity sources, increase the cost of funds, trigger additional collateral or funding requirements and decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing to lend to the Firm. The nature and magnitude of the impact of ratings downgrades depends on numerous contractual and behavioral factors, which the Firm believes are incorporated in its liquidity risk and stress testing metrics. The Firm believes that it maintains sufficient liquidity to withstand a potential decrease in funding capacity due to ratings downgrades. Additionally, the Firm’s funding requirements for VIEs and other third-party commitments may be adversely affected by a decline in credit ratings. Refer to Note 5 and Note 14 for additional information. The credit ratings of the Parent Company and the Firm’s principal bank and non-bank subsidiaries as of December 31, 2023, were as follows: JPMorgan Chase & Co. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. J.P. Morgan Securities LLC J.P. Morgan Securities plc J.P.

(b) On November 13, 2023, Moody’s revised the outlook of the Firm’s principal bank subsidiary from stable to negative to reflect Moody’s change to the U.S. sovereign outlook. JPMorgan Chase’s unsecured debt does not contain requirements that would call for an acceleration of payments, maturities or changes in the structure of the existing debt, provide any limitations on future borrowings or require additional collateral, based on unfavorable changes in the Firm’s credit ratings, financial ratios, earnings, or stock price. Critical factors in maintaining high credit ratings include a stable and diverse earnings stream, strong capital and liquidity ratios, strong credit quality and risk management controls, and diverse funding sources. Rating agencies continue to evaluate economic and geopolitical trends, regulatory developments, future profitability, risk management practices, and litigation matters, as well as their broader ratings methodologies. Changes in any of these factors could lead to changes in the Firm’s credit ratings. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K 109 JPMorgan Chase & Co. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. J.P.

Morgan SE REPUTATION RISK MANAGEMENT Reputation risk is the risk that an action or inaction may negatively impact perception of the Firm’s integrity and reduce confidence in the Firm’s competence by various stakeholders, including clients, counterparties, customers, communities, investors, regulators, or employees. The types of events that may result in reputation risk are wide-ranging and can be introduced by the Firm’s employees, business strategies and activities, clients, customers and counterparties with which the Firm does business. These events could contribute to financial losses, litigation, regulatory enforcement actions, fines, penalties or other sanctions, as well as other harm to the Firm. Organization and management Reputation Risk Management is an independent risk management function that establishes the governance framework for managing reputation risk across the Firm’s LOBs and Corporate. Reputation risk is inherently challenging to identify, manage, and quantify. The Firm’s reputation risk management function includes the following activities: • Maintaining a Firmwide Reputation Risk Governance policy and a standard consistent with the reputation risk framework • Providing oversight of the governance framework through processes and infrastructure to support consistent identification, escalation and monitoring of reputation risk issues Firmwide Governance and oversight The Reputation Risk Governance policy establishes the principles for managing reputation risk for the Firm. It is the responsibility of each LOB, Corporate and employees to consider the reputation of the Firm when deciding whether to offer a new product, engage in a transaction or client relationship, enter a new jurisdiction, initiate a business process or consider any other activity. Environmental impacts and social concerns are increasingly important considerations in assessing the Firm’s reputation risk, and are a component of the Firm’s reputation risk governance. 110 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K CREDIT AND INVESTMENT RISK MANAGEMENT Credit and investment risk is the risk associated with the default or change in credit profile of a client, counterparty or customer; or loss of principal or a reduction in expected returns on investments, including consumer credit risk, wholesale credit risk, and investment portfolio risk. Credit risk management Credit risk is the risk associated with the default or change in credit profile of a client, counterparty or customer. The Firm provides credit to a variety of clients and customers, ranging from large corporate and institutional clients to individual consumers and small businesses. In its consumer businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit risk primarily through its home lending, credit card, auto, and business banking businesses. In its wholesale businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit risk through its underwriting, lending, market-making, and hedging activities with and for clients and counterparties, as well as through its operating services activities (such as cash management and clearing activities), and securities financing activities. The Firm is also exposed to credit risk through its investment securities portfolio and cash placed with banks. Credit Risk Management monitors, measures and manages credit risk throughout the Firm and defines credit risk policies and procedures. The Firm’s credit risk management governance includes the following activities: • Maintaining a credit risk policy framework • Monitoring, measuring and managing credit risk across all portfolio segments, including transaction and exposure approval • Setting industry and geographic concentration limits, as appropriate, and establishing underwriting guidelines • Assigning and managing credit approval authorities in connection with the approval of credit exposure • Managing criticized exposures and delinquent loans, and • Estimating credit losses and supporting appropriate credit risk-based capital management Risk identification and measurement To measure credit risk, the Firm employs several methodologies for estimating the likelihood of obligor or counterparty default. Methodologies for measuring credit risk vary depending on several factors, including type of asset (e.g., consumer versus wholesale), risk measurement parameters (e.g., delinquency status and borrower’s credit score versus wholesale risk-rating) and risk management and collection processes (e.g., retail collection center versus centrally managed workout groups). Credit risk measurement is based on the probability of default of an obligor or counterparty, the loss severity given a default event and the exposure at default. Based on these factors and the methodology and estimates described in Note 13 and Note 10, the Firm estimates credit losses for its exposures. The allowance for loan losses reflects estimated credit losses related to the consumer and wholesale held-for-investment loan portfolios, the allowance for lending-related commitments reflects estimated credit losses related to the Firm’s lending-related commitments and the allowance for investment securities reflects estimated credit losses related to the investment securities portfolio. Refer to Note 13, Note 10 and Critical Accounting Estimates used by the Firm on pages 155–158 for further information. In addition, potential and unexpected credit losses are reflected in the allocation of credit risk capital and represent the potential volatility of actual losses relative to the established allowances for loan losses and lending- related commitments. The analyses for these losses include stress testing that considers alternative economic scenarios as described below. Stress testing Stress testing is important in measuring and managing credit risk in the Firm’s credit portfolio. The stress testing process assesses the potential impact of alternative economic and business scenarios on estimated credit losses for the Firm. Economic scenarios and the underlying parameters are defined centrally, articulated in terms of macroeconomic factors and applied across the businesses. The stress test results may indicate credit migration, changes in delinquency trends and potential losses in the credit portfolio. In addition to the periodic stress testing processes, management also considers additional stresses outside these scenarios, including industry and country- specific stress scenarios, as appropriate. The Firm uses stress testing to inform decisions on setting risk appetite both at a Firm and LOB level, as well as to assess the impact of stress on individual counterparties. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K 111 Risk monitoring and management The Firm has developed policies and practices that are designed to preserve the independence and integrity of the approval and decision-making process for extending credit so that credit risks are assessed accurately, approved properly, monitored regularly and managed actively at both the transaction and portfolio levels. The policy framework establishes credit approval authorities, concentration limits, risk-rating methodologies, portfolio review parameters and guidelines for management of distressed exposures. In addition, certain models, assumptions and inputs used in evaluating and monitoring credit risk are independently validated by groups that are separate from the LOBs. Consumer credit risk is monitored for delinquency and other trends, including any concentrations at the portfolio level, as certain of these trends can be addressed through changes in underwriting policies and portfolio guidelines. Consumer Risk Management evaluates delinquency and other trends against business expectations, current and forecasted economic conditions, and industry benchmarks. Historical and forecasted economic performance and trends are incorporated into the modeling of estimated consumer credit losses and are part of the monitoring of the credit risk profile of the portfolio. Wholesale credit risk is monitored regularly at an aggregate portfolio, industry, and individual client and counterparty level with established concentration limits that are reviewed and revised periodically as deemed appropriate by management. Industry and counterparty limits, as measured in terms of exposure and economic risk appetite, are subject to stress-based loss constraints. Management of the Firm’s wholesale credit risk exposure is accomplished through a number of means, including: • Loan underwriting and credit approval processes • Loan syndications and participations • Loan sales and securitizations • Credit derivatives • Master netting agreements, and • Collateral and other risk-reduction techniques In addition to Credit Risk Management, an independent Credit Review function is responsible for: • Independently assessing risk grades assigned to exposures in the Firm’s wholesale credit portfolio and the timeliness of risk grade changes initiated by responsible business units; and • Evaluating the effectiveness of the credit management processes of the LOBs and Corporate, including the adequacy of credit analyses and risk grading/loss given default (“LGD”) rationales, proper monitoring and management of credit exposures, and compliance with applicable grading policies and underwriting guidelines. Refer to Note 12 for further discussion of consumer and wholesale loans. Risk reporting To enable monitoring of credit risk and effective decision- making, aggregate credit exposure, credit quality forecasts, concentration levels and risk profile changes are reported regularly to senior members of Credit Risk Management. Detailed portfolio reporting of industry, clients, counterparties and customers, product and geography are prepared, and the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses is reviewed by senior management at least on a quarterly basis. Through the risk reporting and governance structure, credit risk trends and limit exceptions are provided regularly to, and discussed with, risk committees, senior management and the Board of Directors. Management’s discussion and analysis 112 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K CREDIT PORTFOLIO Credit risk is the risk associated with the default or change in credit profile of a client, counterparty or customer. In the following tables, total loans include loans retained (i.e., held-for-investment); loans held-for-sale; and certain loans accounted for at fair value. The following tables do not include loans which the Firm accounts for at fair value and classifies as trading assets; refer to Notes 2 and 3 for further information regarding these loans. Refer to Notes 12 , 28, and 5 for additional information on the Firm’s loans, lending-related commitments and derivative receivables, including the Firm’s related accounting policies.

On January 1, 2023, the Firm adopted changes to the TDR accounting guidance, which eliminated the accounting and disclosure requirements for TDRs including the requirement to assess whether a modification is reasonably expected or involves a concession. The new guidance requires disclosure of loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty consisting of principal forgiveness, interest rate reduction, other-than-insignificant payment delay, term extension or a combination of these modifications. The Firm has defined these types of modifications as financial difficulty modifications (\"FDMs\"). As a result of the elimination of the requirement to assess whether a modification is reasonably expected or involves a concession, the population of loans considered FDMs differs from the population previously considered TDRs.

Management’s discussion and analysis 116 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K Consumer, excluding credit card Portfolio analysis Loans increased from December 31, 2022 driven by residential real estate loans associated with First Republic and higher auto loans. The following discussions provide information concerning individual loan products. Refer to Note 12 for further information about this portfolio, including information about delinquencies, loan modifications and other credit quality indicators. Residential real estate: The residential real estate portfolio, including loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value, predominantly consists of prime mortgage loans and home equity lines of credit. Retained loans increased compared to December 31, 2022 driven by residential real estate loans associated with First Republic. Retained nonaccrual loans decreased compared to December 31, 2022 predominantly driven by loan sales, partially offset by the net impact of paydowns and additions, including those associated with First Republic. Net recoveries were lower for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the prior year driven by lower prepayments due to higher interest rates. Loans at fair value increased from December 31, 2022, driven by an increase in Home Lending as originations outpaced warehouse loan sales, and in CIB as purchases outpaced sales and paydowns. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the carrying values of interest-only residential mortgage loans were $90.6 billion and $36.3 billion, respectively. The increase was driven by First Republic. These loans have an interest-only payment period generally followed by an adjustable-rate or fixed- rate fully amortizing payment period to maturity and are typically originated as higher-balance loans to higher- income borrowers. The credit performance of this portfolio is comparable with the performance of the broader prime mortgage portfolio. The carrying value of home equity lines of credit outstanding was $16.1 billion at December 31, 2023, which included $2.6 billion associated with First Republic. The carrying value of home equity lines of credit outstanding included $4.2 billion of HELOCs that have recast from interest-only to fully amortizing payments or have been modified and $4.3 billion of interest-only balloon HELOCs, which primarily mature after 2030. The Firm manages the risk of HELOCs during their revolving period by closing or reducing the undrawn line to the extent permitted by law when borrowers are exhibiting a material deterioration in their credit risk profile. The following table provides a summary of the Firm’s residential mortgage portfolio insured and/or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies, predominantly loans held-for- sale and loans at fair value. The Firm monitors its exposure to certain potential unrecoverable claim payments related to government-insured loans and considers this exposure in estimating the allowance for loan losses.

Average current estimated loan-to-value (“LTV”) ratios have improved, reflecting an increase in home prices. Refer to Note 12 for information on the geographic composition and current estimated LTVs of the Firm’s residential real estate loans. Modified residential real estate loans For the year ended December 31, 2023, residential real estate FDMs were $136 million. In addition to FDMs, the Firm also had $69 million of loans subject to trial modification where the terms of the loans have not been permanently modified, as well as $9 million of loans subject to discharge under Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceedings (\"Chapter 7 loans\"). The changes to the TDR accounting guidance eliminated the TDR reasonably expected and concession assessment criteria. Accordingly, trial modifications and Chapter 7 loans were considered TDRs, but not FDMs. Refer to Note 1 and Note 12 for further information. For the year ended December 31, 2022, residential real estate TDRs were $362 million. Refer to Note 12 for further information on TDRs in prior periods. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K 117 Auto and other: The auto and other loan portfolio, including loans at fair value, generally consists of prime- quality scored auto and business banking loans, other consumer unsecured loans, and overdrafts. The portfolio increased when compared to December 31, 2022 due to originations of scored auto loans and an increase in other consumer unsecured fair value option loans in CIB associated with First Republic, largely offset by paydowns. Net charge-offs for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased compared to the prior year due to higher charge- offs of scored auto loans driven by the decline in used vehicle valuations. The scored auto net charge-off rates were 0.56% and 0.24% for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Nonperforming assets The following table presents information as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, about consumer, excluding credit card, nonperforming assets.

Management’s discussion and analysis 118 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K Credit card Total credit card loans increased from December 31, 2022 reflecting growth from new accounts and revolving balances which continued to normalize to pre-pandemic levels. The December 31, 2023 30+ and 90+ day delinquency rates of 2.14% and 1.05%, respectively, increased compared to the December 31, 2022 30+ and 90+ day delinquency rates of 1.45% and 0.68%, respectively. Net charge-offs increased for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the prior year as delinquencies have normalized. Consistent with the Firm’s policy, all credit card loans typically remain on accrual status until charged off. However, the Firm’s allowance for loan losses includes the estimated uncollectible portion of accrued and billed interest and fee income. Geographic and FICO composition of credit card loans At December 31, 2023, $98.1 billion, or 46% of the total retained credit card loan portfolio, was concentrated in California, Texas, New York, Florida and Illinois, compared with $85.4 billion, or 46%, at December 31, 2022. Modifications of credit card loans For the year ended December 31, 2023, credit card FDMs were $648 million. FDMs increased for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to credit card TDRs in the prior year, as delinquencies have normalized. In addition to FDMs, the Firm also had $27 million of loans subject to trial modification where the terms of the loans have not been permanently modified for the year ended December 31, 2023. The changes to the TDR accounting guidance eliminated the TDR reasonably expected and concession assessment criteria. Accordingly, trial modifications were considered TDRs, but not FDMs. For the year ended December 31, 2022, credit card TDRs were $418 million. Refer to Note 1 and Note 12 for further information about this portfolio, including information about delinquencies, geographic and FICO composition, and modifications. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K 119 WHOLESALE CREDIT PORTFOLIO In its wholesale businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit risk primarily through its underwriting, lending, market- making, and hedging activities with and for clients and counterparties, as well as through various operating services (such as cash management and clearing activities), securities financing activities and cash placed with banks. A portion of the loans originated or acquired by the Firm’s wholesale businesses is generally retained on the balance sheet. The Firm distributes a significant percentage of the loans that it originates into the market as part of its syndicated loan business and to manage portfolio concentrations and credit risk. The wholesale portfolio is actively managed, in part by conducting ongoing, in-depth reviews of client credit quality and transaction structure, inclusive of collateral where applicable, and of industry, product and client concentrations. Refer to the industry discussion on pages 122–125 for further information. The Firm’s wholesale credit portfolio includes exposure held in CIB, CB, AWM, and Corporate, and risk-rated exposure held in CCB, for which the wholesale methodology is applied when determining the allowance for loan losses. The Firm continues to convert certain operations, and to integrate clients, products and services, associated with First Republic. Accordingly, reporting classifications and internal risk rating profiles in the wholesale portfolio may change in future periods. Refer to Business Developments on page 53 for additional information. As of December 31, 2023, retained loans increased $68.8 billion predominantly driven by the impact of First Republic. Lending-related commitments increased $64.8 billion, driven by the impact of First Republic, and net portfolio activity in CIB and CB. As of December 31, 2023, nonperforming exposure increased $476 million predominantly driven by nonperforming retained loans in Real Estate and Healthcare, reflecting downgrades, and Individuals largely driven by the impact of First Republic, partially offset by a single name upgrade in Civic Organizations. For the year ended December 31, 2023, wholesale net charge-offs increased $698 million, predominantly driven by the restructuring of a loan, increases in Real Estate (concentrated in Office) and Consumer & Retail.

The contractual amounts of these financial instruments represent the maximum possible credit risk should the clients draw down on these commitments or when the Firm fulfills its obligations under these guarantees, and the clients subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of these contracts. Most of these commitments and guarantees have historically been refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired without being drawn upon or a default occurring. As a result, the Firm does not believe that the total contractual amount of these wholesale lending-related commitments is representative of the Firm’s expected future credit exposure or funding requirements. Refer to Note 28 for further information on wholesale lending-related commitments. Receivables from customers Receivables from customers reflect held-for-investment margin loans to brokerage clients in CIB, CCB and AWM that are collateralized by assets maintained in the clients’ brokerage accounts (including cash on deposit, and primarily liquid and readily marketable debt or equity securities). To manage its credit risk, the Firm establishes margin requirements and monitors the required margin levels on an ongoing basis, and requires clients to deposit additional cash or other collateral, or to reduce positions, when appropriate. Credit risk arising from lending activities subject to collateral maintenance requirements is generally mitigated by factors such as the short-term nature of the activity, the fair value of collateral held and the Firm’s right to call for, and the borrower’s obligation to provide, additional margin when the fair value of the collateral declines. Because of these mitigating factors, these receivables generally do not require an allowance for credit losses. However, if in management’s judgment, an allowance for credit losses is required, the Firm estimates expected credit losses based on the value of the collateral and probability of borrower default. These receivables are reported within accrued interest and accounts receivable on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets. Refer to Note 13 for further information on the Firm’s accounting policies for the allowance for credit losses. Derivative contracts Derivatives enable clients and counterparties to manage risk, including credit risk and risks arising from fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange and equities and commodities prices. The Firm makes markets in derivatives in order to meet these needs and uses derivatives to manage certain risks associated with net open risk positions from its market-making activities, including the counterparty credit risk arising from derivative receivables. The Firm also uses derivative instruments to manage its own credit risk and other market risk exposure. The nature of the counterparty and the settlement mechanism of the derivative affect the credit risk to which the Firm is exposed. For OTC derivatives, the Firm is exposed to the credit risk of the derivative counterparty. For exchange-traded derivatives (“ETD”), such as futures and options, and cleared over-the-counter (“OTC- cleared”) derivatives, the Firm can also be exposed to the credit risk of the relevant CCP. Where possible, the Firm seeks to mitigate its credit risk exposures arising from derivative contracts through the use of legally enforceable master netting arrangements and collateral agreements. The percentage of the Firm’s OTC derivative transactions subject to collateral agreements — excluding foreign exchange spot trades, which are not typically covered by collateral agreements due to their short maturity and centrally cleared trades that are settled daily — was approximately 87% at both December 31, 2023 and 2022. Refer to Note 5 for additional information on the Firm’s use of collateral agreements and further discussion of derivative contracts, counterparties and settlement types. The fair value of derivative receivables reported on the Consolidated balance sheets was $54.9 billion and $70.9 billion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease was primarily as a result of market movements. Derivative receivables represent the fair value of the derivative contracts after giving effect to legally enforceable master netting agreements and the related cash collateral held by the Firm. In addition, the Firm holds liquid securities and other cash collateral that may be used as security when the fair value of the client’s exposure is in the Firm’s favor. For these purposes, the definition of liquid securities is consistent with the definition of high quality liquid assets as defined in the LCR rule. In management’s view, the appropriate measure of current credit risk should also take into consideration other collateral, which generally represents securities that do not qualify as high quality liquid assets under the LCR rule. The benefits of these additional collateral amounts for each counterparty are subject to a legally enforceable master netting agreement and limited to the net amount of the derivative receivables for each counterparty. The Firm also holds additional collateral (primarily cash, G7 government securities, other liquid government agency and guaranteed securities, and corporate debt and equity securities) delivered by clients at the initiation of transactions, as well as collateral related to contracts that have a non-daily call frequency and collateral that the Firm has agreed to return but has not yet settled as of the reporting date. Although this collateral does not reduce the receivables balances and is not included in the tables below, it is available as security against potential exposure that could arise should the fair value of the client’s derivative contracts move in the Firm’s favor. Refer to Note 5 for additional information on the Firm’s use of collateral agreements for derivative transactions. Management’s discussion and analysis 128 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K The following tables summarize the net derivative receivables and the internal ratings profile for the periods presented. Derivative receivables December 31, (in millions) 2023 2022 Total, net of cash collateral $ 54,864 $ 70,880 Liquid securities and other cash collateral held against derivative receivables (22,461) (23,014) Total, net of liquid securities and other cash collateral $ 32,403 $ 47,866 Other collateral held against derivative receivables (993) (1,261) Total, net of collateral $ 31,410 $ 46,605 Ratings profile of derivative receivables 2023 2022 December 31, (in millions, except ratios) Exposure net of collateral % of exposure net of collateral Exposure net of collateral % of exposure net of collateral Investment-grade $ 24,004 76 % $ 35,097 75 % Noninvestment-grade 7,406 24 11,508 25 Total $ 31,410 100 % $ 46,605 100 % While useful as a current view of credit exposure, the net fair value of the derivative receivables does not capture the potential future variability of that credit exposure. To capture this variability, the Firm calculates, on a client-by- client basis, three measures of potential derivatives-related credit loss: Peak, Derivative Risk Equivalent (“DRE”), and Average exposure (“AVG”). These measures all incorporate netting and collateral benefits, where applicable. Peak represents a conservative measure of potential derivative exposure, including the benefit of collateral, to a counterparty calculated in a manner that is broadly equivalent to a 97.5% confidence level over the life of the transaction. Peak is the primary measure used by the Firm for setting credit limits for derivative contracts, senior management reporting and derivatives exposure management. DRE exposure is a measure that expresses the risk of derivative exposure, including the benefit of collateral, on a basis intended to be equivalent to the risk of loan exposures. DRE is a less extreme measure of potential credit loss than Peak and is used as an input for aggregating derivative credit risk exposures with loans and other credit risk. Finally, AVG is a measure of the expected fair value of the Firm’s derivative exposures, including the benefit of collateral, at future time periods. AVG over the total life of the derivative contract is used as the primary metric for pricing purposes and is used to calculate credit risk capital and CVA, as further described below. The fair value of the Firm’s derivative receivables incorporates CVA to reflect the credit quality of counterparties. CVA is based on the Firm’s AVG to a counterparty and the counterparty’s credit spread in the credit derivatives market. The Firm believes that active risk management is essential to controlling the dynamic credit risk in the derivatives portfolio. In addition, the Firm’s risk management process for derivatives exposures takes into consideration the potential impact of wrong-way risk, which is broadly defined as the risk that exposure to a counterparty is positively correlated with the impact of a default by the same counterparty, which could cause exposure to increase at the same time as the counterparty’s capacity to meet its obligations is decreasing. Many factors may influence the nature and magnitude of these correlations over time. To the extent that these correlations are identified, the Firm may adjust the CVA associated with a particular counterparty’s AVG. The Firm risk manages exposure to changes in CVA by entering into credit derivative contracts, as well as interest rate, foreign exchange, equity and commodity derivative contracts. The below graph shows exposure profiles to the Firm’s c urrent derivatives portfolio over the next 10 years as calculated by the Peak, DRE and AVG metrics. The three measures generally show that exposure will decline after the first year, if no new trades are added to the portfolio.

Credit portfolio management activities Included in the Firm’s end-user activities are credit derivatives used to mitigate the credit risk associated with traditional lending activities (loans and lending-related commitments) and derivatives counterparty exposure in the Firm’s wholesale businesses (collectively, “credit portfolio management activities”). Information on credit portfolio management activities is provided in the table below. The Firm also uses credit derivatives as an end-user to manage other exposures, including credit risk arising from certain securities held in the Firm’s market-making businesses. These credit derivatives are not included in credit portfolio management activities.

The credit derivatives used in credit portfolio management activities do not qualify for hedge accounting under U.S. GAAP; these derivatives are reported at fair value, with gains and losses recognized in principal transactions revenue. In contrast, the loans and lending-related commitments being risk-managed are accounted for on an accrual basis. This asymmetry in accounting treatment, between loans and lending-related commitments and the credit derivatives used in credit portfolio management activities, causes earnings volatility that is not representative, in the Firm’s view, of the true changes in value of the Firm’s overall credit exposure. The effectiveness of credit default swaps (“CDS”) as a hedge against the Firm’s exposures may vary depending on a number of factors, including the named reference entity (i.e., the Firm may experience losses on specific exposures that are different than the named reference entities in the purchased CDS); the contractual terms of the CDS (which may have a defined credit event that does not align with an actual loss realized by the Firm); and the maturity of the Firm’s CDS protection (which in some cases may be shorter than the Firm’s exposures). However, the Firm generally seeks to purchase credit protection with a maturity date that is the same or similar to the maturity date of the exposure for which the protection was purchased, and remaining differences in maturity are actively monitored and managed by the Firm. Refer to Credit derivatives in Note 5 for further information on credit derivatives and derivatives used in credit portfolio management activities. Management’s discussion and analysis 130 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K Notional amount of protection purchased and sold(a) ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES The Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents management's estimate of expected credit losses over the remaining expected life of the Firm's financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. The Firm’s allowance for credit losses generally consists of: • the allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated) and is presented separately on the Consolidated balance sheets, • the allowance for lending-related commitments, which is reflected in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets, and • the allowance for credit losses on investment securities, w hich is reflected in investment securities on the Consolidated balance sheets. Discussion of changes in the allowance The allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2023 was $24.8 billion, reflecting a net addition of $3.1 billion from December 31, 2022. The net addition to the allowance for credit losses included $1.9 billion, consisting of: • $1.3 billion in consumer, predominantly driven by CCB, comprised of $1.4 billion in Card Services, partially offset by a net reduction of $200 million in Home Lending. The net addition in Card Services was driven by loan growth, including an increase in revolving balances, partially offset by reduced borrower uncertainty. The net reduction in Home Lending was driven by improvements in the outlook for home prices, and • $675 million in wholesale, driven by net downgrade activity, the net effect of changes in the Firm’s weighted average macroeconomic outlook, including deterioration in the outlook for commercial real estate in CB, and an addition for certain accounts receivable in CIB, partially offset by the impact of changes in the loan and lending- related commitment portfolios. The net addition also included $1.2 billion to establish the allowance for the First Republic loans and lending-related commitments in the second quarter of 2023. The changes in the Firm's weighted average macroeconomic outlook also included updates to the central scenario in the third quarter of 2023 to reflect a lower forecasted unemployment rate consistent with a higher growth rate in GDP, and the impact of the additional weight placed on the adverse scenarios in the first quarter of 2023, reflecting elevated recession risks due to high inflation and tightening financial conditions. The allowance for credit losses also reflected a reduction of $587 million as a result of the adoption of changes to the TDR accounting guidance on January 1, 2023. Refer to Note 1 for further information. The Firm's allowance for credit losses is estimated using a weighted average of five internally developed macroeconomic scenarios. The adverse scenarios incorporate more punitive macroeconomic factors than the central case assumptions provided in the table below, resulting in a weighted average U.S. unemployment rate peaking at 5.5% in the fourth quarter of 2024, and a weighted average U.S. real GDP level that is 1.5% lower than the central case at the end of the second quarter of 2025 . The following table presents the Firm’s central case assumptions for the periods presented: Central case assumptions at December 31, 2023 2Q24 4Q24 2Q25 U.S. unemployment rate(a) 4.1 % 4.4 % 4.1 % YoY growth in U.S. real GDP(b) 1.8 % 0.7 % 1.0 % Central case assumptions at December 31, 2022 2Q23 4Q23 2Q24 U.S. unemployment rate(a) 3.8 % 4.3 % 5.0 % YoY growth in U.S. real GDP(b) 1.5 % 0.4 % — % (a) Reflects quarterly average of forecasted U.S. unemployment rate. (b) The year over year growth in U.S. real GDP in the forecast horizon of the central scenario is calculated as the percentage change in U.S. real GDP levels from the prior year. Subsequent changes to this forecast and related estimates will be reflected in the provision for credit losses in future periods.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K 133 2023 2022 INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO RISK MANAGEMENT Investment portfolio risk is the risk associated with the loss of principal or a reduction in expected returns on investments arising from the investment securities portfolio or from principal investments. The investment securities portfolio is predominantly held by Treasury and CIO in connection with the Firm's balance sheet and asset-liability management objectives. Principal investments are predominantly privately-held financial instruments and are managed in the LOBs and Corporate. Investments are typically intended to be held over extended periods and, accordingly, the Firm has no expectation for short-term realized gains with respect to these investments. Investment securities risk Investment securities risk includes the exposure associated with a default in the payment of principal and interest. This risk is mitigated given that the investment securities portfolio held by Treasury and CIO predominantly consists of high-quality securities. At December 31, 2023, the Treasury and CIO investment securities portfolio, net of the allowance for credit losses, was $569.2 billion, and the average credit rating of the securities comprising the portfolio was AA+ (based upon external ratings where available, and where not available, based primarily upon internal risk ratings). Refer to Corporate segment results on pages 84–85 and Note 10 for further information on the investment securities portfolio and internal risk ratings. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 102–109 for further information on related liquidity risk. Refer to Market Risk Management on pages 135–143 for further information on the market risk inherent in the portfolio. Governance and oversight Investment securities risks are governed by the Firm’s Risk Appetite framework, and reviewed at the CTC Risk Committee with regular updates provided to the Board Risk Committee. The Firm’s independent control functions are responsible for reviewing the appropriateness of the carrying value of investment securities in accordance with relevant policies. Approved levels for investment securities are established for each risk category, including capital and credit risks. Principal investment risk Principal investments are typically privately-held financial instruments representing ownership interests or other forms of junior capital. In general, principal investments include tax-oriented investments and investments made to enhance or accelerate the Firm’s business strategies and exclude those that are consolidated on the Firm's balance sheets. These investments are made by dedicated investing businesses or as part of a broader business strategy. The Firm’s principal investments are managed by the LOBs and Corporate and are reflected within their respective financial results. The Firm’s investments will continue to evolve based on market circumstances and in line with its strategic initiatives, including the Firm’s environmental and social goals. The table below presents the aggregate carrying values of the principal investment portfolios as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. (in billions) December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 Tax-oriented investments, primarily in alternative energy and affordable housing(a) $ 28.8 $ 26.2 Private equity, various debt and equity instruments, and real assets 10.5 10.8 Total carrying value $ 39.3 $ 37.0 (a) As of December 31, 2023, included approximately $1.0 billion in tax- oriented investments in CIB associated with First Republic. Governance and oversight The Firm’s approach to managing principal investment risk is consistent with the Firm’s risk governance structure. The Firm has established a Firmwide risk policy framework for all principal investing activities that includes approval by executives who are independent from the investing businesses, as appropriate. The Firm’s independent control functions are responsible for reviewing the appropriateness of the carrying value of investments in accordance with relevant policies. As part of the risk governance structure, approved levels for investments are established and monitored for each relevant business or segment in order to manage the overall size of the portfolios. The Firm also conducts stress testing on these portfolios using specific scenarios that estimate losses based on significant market moves and/or other risk events. Management’s discussion and analysis 134 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT Market risk is the risk associated with the effect of changes in market factors such as interest and foreign exchange rates, equity and commodity prices, credit spreads or implied volatilities, on the value of assets and liabilities held for both the short and long term. Market Risk Management Market Risk Management monitors market risks throughout the Firm and defines market risk policies and procedures. Market Risk Management seeks to manage risk, facilitate efficient risk/return decisions, reduce volatility in operating performance and provide transparency into the Firm’s market risk profile for senior management, the Board of Directors and regulators. Market Risk Management is responsible for the following functions: • Maintaining a market risk policy framework • Independently measuring, monitoring and controlling LOB, Corporate, and Firmwide market risk • Defining, approving and monitoring limits • Performing stress testing and qualitative risk assessments Risk measurement Measures used to capture market risk There is no single measure to capture market risk and therefore Market Risk Management uses various metrics, both statistical and nonstatistical, to assess risk including: • Value-at-risk • Stress testing • Profit and loss drawdowns • Earnings-at-risk • Economic Value Sensitivity • Other sensitivity-based measures Risk monitoring and control Market risk exposure is managed primarily through a series of limits set in the context of the market environment and business strategy. In setting limits, Market Risk Management takes into consideration factors such as market volatility, product liquidity, accommodation of client business, and management judgment. Market Risk Management maintains different levels of limits. Firm level limits include VaR and stress limits. Similarly, LOB and Corporate limits include VaR and stress limits and may be supplemented by certain nonstatistical risk measures such as profit and loss drawdowns. Limits may also be set within the LOBs and Corporate, as well as at the legal entity level. Market Risk Management sets limits and regularly reviews and updates them as appropriate. Senior management is responsible for reviewing and approving certain of these risk limits on an ongoing basis. Limits that have not been reviewed within specified time periods by Market Risk Management are reported to senior management. The LOBs and Corporate are responsible for adhering to established limits against which exposures are monitored and reported. Limit breaches are required to be reported in a timely manner to limit approvers, which include Market Risk Management and senior management. In the event of a breach, Market Risk Management consults with senior members of appropriate groups within the Firm to determine the suitable course of action required to return the applicable positions to compliance, which may include a reduction in risk in order to remedy the breach or granting a temporary increase in limits to accommodate an expected increase in client activity and/or market volatility. Firm, Corporate or LOB-level limit breaches are escalated as appropriate. Models used to measure market risk are inherently imprecise and are limited in their ability to measure certain risks or to predict losses. This imprecision may be heightened when sudden or severe shifts in market conditions occur. For additional discussion on model uncertainty refer to Estimations and Model Risk Management on page 154. Market Risk Management periodically reviews the Firm’s existing market risk measures to identify opportunities for enhancement, and to the extent appropriate, will calibrate those measures accordingly over time. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K 135 The following table summarizes the predominant business activities and related market risks, as well as positions which give rise to market risk and certain measures used to capture those risks, for each LOB and Corporate. In addition to the predominant business activities, each LOB and Corporate may engage in principal investing activities.

Management’s discussion and analysis 136 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K Value-at-risk JPMorgan Chase utilizes value-at-risk (“VaR”), a statistical risk measure, to estimate the potential loss from adverse market moves in the current market environment. The Firm has a single VaR framework used as a basis for calculating Risk Management VaR and Regulatory VaR. The framework is employed across the Firm using historical simulation based on data for the previous 12 months. The framework’s approach assumes that historical changes in market values are representative of the distribution of potential outcomes in the immediate future. The Firm believes the use of Risk Management VaR provides a daily measure of risk that is closely aligned to risk management decisions made by the LOBs and Corporate and, along with other market risk measures, provides the appropriate information needed to respond to risk events. The Firm’s Risk Management VaR is calculated assuming a one-day holding period and an expected tail-loss methodology which approximates a 95% confidence level. Risk Management VaR provides a consistent framework to measure risk profiles and levels of diversification across product types and is used for aggregating risks and monitoring limits across businesses. VaR results are reported as appropriate to various groups including senior management, the Board Risk Committee and regulators. Underlying the overall VaR model framework are individual VaR models that simulate historical market returns for individual risk factors and/or product types. To capture material market risks as part of the Firm’s risk management framework, comprehensive VaR model calculations are performed daily for businesses whose activities give rise to market risk. These VaR models are granular and incorporate numerous risk factors and inputs to simulate daily changes in market values over the historical period; inputs are selected based on the risk profile of each portfolio, as sensitivities and historical time series used to generate daily market values may be different across product types or risk management systems. The VaR model results across all portfolios are aggregated at the Firm level. As VaR is based on historical data, it is an imperfect measure of market risk exposure and potential future losses. In addition, based on their reliance on available historical data, limited time horizons, and other factors, VaR measures are inherently limited in their ability to measure certain risks and to predict losses, particularly those associated with market illiquidity and sudden or severe shifts in market conditions. For certain products, specific risk parameters are not captured in VaR due to the lack of liquidity and availability of appropriate historical data. The Firm uses proxies to estimate the VaR for these and other products when daily time series are not available. It is likely that using an actual price-based time series for these products, if available, would affect the VaR results presented. The Firm therefore considers other nonstatistical measures such as stress testing, in addition to VaR, to capture and manage its market risk positions. As VaR model calculations require daily data and a consistent source for valuation, the daily market data used may be different than the independent third-party data collected for VCG price testing in its monthly valuation process. For example, in cases where market prices are not observable, or where proxies are used in VaR historical time series, the data sources may differ. Refer to Valuation process in Note 2 for further information on the Firm’s valuation process. The Firm’s VaR model calculations are periodically evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the composition of the Firm’s portfolios, changes in market conditions, improvements in the Firm’s modeling techniques and measurements, and other factors. Such changes may affect historical comparisons of VaR results. Refer to Estimations and Model Risk Management on page 154 for information regarding model reviews and approvals. The Firm calculates separately a daily aggregated VaR in accordance with regulatory rules (“Regulatory VaR”), which is used to derive the Firm’s regulatory VaR-based capital requirements under Basel III capital rules. This Regulatory VaR model framework currently assumes a ten business-day holding period and an expected tail loss methodology which approximates a 99% confidence level. Regulatory VaR is applied to “covered” positions as defined by Basel III capital rules, which may be different than the positions included in the Firm’s Risk Management VaR. For example, credit derivative hedges of accrual loans are included in the Firm’s Risk Management VaR, while Regulatory VaR excludes these credit derivative hedges. In addition, in contrast to the Firm’s Risk Management VaR, Regulatory VaR currently excludes the diversification benefit for certain VaR models. Refer to JPMorgan Chase’s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are available on the Firm’s website, for additional information on Regulatory VaR and the other components of market risk regulatory capital for the Firm (e.g., VaR-based measure, stressed VaR-based measure and the respective backtesting). JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K 137 The table below shows the results of the Firm’s Risk Management VaR measure using a 95% confidence level. VaR can vary significantly as positions change, market volatility fluctuates, and diversification benefits change. Total VaR As of or for the year ended December 31, 2023 2022 (in millions) Avg. Min Max Avg.

This reflects the non-additive nature of VaR due to imperfect correlation across LOBs, Corporate, and risk types. For maximum and minimum VaR, diversification benefit is not meaningful as the maximum and minimum VaR for each portfolio may have occurred on different trading days than the components. (b) Credit Portfolio VaR includes the derivative CVA, hedges of the CVA and hedges of the retained loan portfolio, which are reported in principal transactions revenue. This VaR does not include the retained loan portfolio, which is not reported at fair value. In line with the Firm's internal model governance, the credit risk component of CVA related to certain counterparties was removed from Credit Portfolio VaR due to the widening of the credit spreads for those counterparties to elevated levels. The related hedges were also removed to maintain consistency. This exposure is now reflected in other sensitivity-based measures. (c) Corporate and other LOB VaR includes a legacy private equity position in Corporate which is publicly traded . (d) In March 2022, the effects of nickel price increases and the associated volatility in the nickel market resulted in elevated maximum Credit Portfolio VaR, as well as maximum Total VaR. 2023 compared with 2022 Average Total VaR decreased by $15 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 when compared with the prior year. The decrease was driven by reduced market volatility and risk reductions predominantly impacting fixed income, commodities and equities. The following graph presents daily Risk Management VaR for the four trailing quarters. Daily Risk Management VaR $ millions 0 25 50 75 First Quarter 2023 Second Quarter 2023 Third Quarter 2023 Fourth Quarter 2023 Management’s discussion and analysis 138 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K 2023 20222023 2022 VaR backtesting The Firm performs daily VaR model backtesting, which compares the daily Risk Management VaR results with the daily gains and losses that are utilized for VaR backtesting purposes. The gains and losses depicted in the chart below do not reflect the Firm’s reported revenue as they exclude certain components of total net revenue, such as those associated with the execution of new transactions (i.e., intraday client-driven trading and intraday risk management activities), fees, commissions, other valuation adjustments and net interest income. These excluded components of total net revenue may more than offset the backtesting gain or loss on a particular day. The definition of backtesting gains and losses above is consistent with the requirements for backtesting under Basel III capital rules. A backtesting exception occurs when the daily backtesting loss exceeds the daily Risk Management VaR for the prior day. Under the Firm’s Risk Management VaR methodology, assuming current changes in market values are consistent with the historical changes used in the simulation, the Firm would expect to incur VaR backtesting exceptions five times every 100 trading days on average. The number of VaR backtesting exceptions observed can differ from the statistically expected number of backtesting exceptions if the current level of market volatility is materially different from the level of market volatility during the 12 months of historical data used in the VaR calculation. For the 12 months ended December 31, 2023, the Firm posted backtesting gains on 139 of the 258 days, and observed 13 VaR backtesting exceptions, of which eight were in the three months ended December 31, 2023. Firmwide backte sting loss days can differ from the loss days for which Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets posted losses, as disclosed in CIB Markets revenue, as the population of positions which comprise each metric are different and due to the exclusion of certain components of total net revenue in backtesting gains and losses as described above. The following chart presents the distribution of Firmwide daily backtesting gains and losses for the trailing 12 months and three months ended December 31, 2023. The daily backtesting losses are displayed as a percentage of the corresponding daily Risk Management VaR. The count of days with backtesting losses are shown in aggregate, in fifty percentage point intervals. Backtesting exceptions are displayed within the intervals that are greater than one hundred percent. The results in the chart below differ from the results of backtesting disclosed in the Market Risk section of the Firm’s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are based on Regulatory VaR applied to the Firm’s covered positions.

While VaR reflects the risk of loss due to adverse changes in markets using recent historical market behavior, stress testing reflects the risk of loss from hypothetical changes in the value of market risk sensitive positions applied simultaneously. Stress testing measures the Firm’s vulnerability to losses under a range of stressed but possible economic and market scenarios. The results are used to understand the exposures responsible for those potential losses and are measured against limits. The Firm’s stress framework covers market risk sensitive positions in the LOBs and Corporate. The framework is used to calculate multiple magnitudes of potential stress for both market rallies and market sell-offs, assuming significant changes in market factors such as credit spreads, equity prices, interest rates, currency rates and commodity prices, and combines them in multiple ways to capture an array of hypothetical economic and market scenarios. The Firm generates a number of scenarios that focus on tail events in specific asset classes and geographies, including how the event may impact multiple market factors simultaneously. Scenarios also incorporate specific idiosyncratic risks and stress basis risk between different products. The flexibility in the stress framework allows the Firm to construct new scenarios that can test the outcomes against possible future stress events. Stress testing results are reported periodically to senior management of the Firm, as appropriate. Stress scenarios are governed by the overall stress framework, under the oversight of Market Risk Management, and the models to calculate the stress results are subject to the Firm’s Estimations and Model Risk Management Policy. The Firmwide Market Risk Stress Methodology Committee reviews and approves changes to stress testing methodology and scenarios across the Firm. Significant changes to the framework are escalated to senior management, as appropriate. The Firm’s stress testing framework is utilized in calculating the Firm’s CCAR and other stress test results, which are reported periodically to the Board of Directors. In addition, stress testing results are incorporated into the Firm’s Risk Appetite framework, and are reported periodically to the Board Risk Committee. Profit and loss drawdowns Profit and loss drawdowns are used to highlight trading losses above certain levels of risk tolerance. A profit and loss drawdown is a decline in revenue from its year-to-date peak level. Structural interest rate risk management The effect of interest rate exposure on the Firm’s reported net income is important as interest rate risk represents one of the Firm’s significant market risks. Interest rate risk arises not only from trading activities which are included in VaR, but also from the Firm’s traditional banking activities, which include extension of loans and credit facilities, taking deposits, issuing debt, as well as the investment securities portfolio, and associated derivative instruments. Refer to the table on page 136 for a summary by LOB and Corporate identifying positions included in earnings-at-risk. Governance The CTC Risk Committee establishes the Firm’s interest rate risk management policy and related limits, which are subject to approval by the Board Risk Committee. Treasury and CIO, working in partnership with the LOBs, calculates the Firm’s structural interest rate risk profile and reviews it with senior management, including the CTC Risk Committee. In addition, oversight of structural interest rate risk is managed through a dedicated risk function reporting to the CTC CRO. This risk function is responsible for providing independent oversight and governance around assumptions and establishing and monitoring limits for structural interest rate risk, including limits related to Earnings-at- Risk and Economic Value Sensitivity. The Firm manages structural interest rate risk generally through its investment securities portfolio and interest rate derivatives. Key Risk Drivers and Risk Management Process Structural interest rate risk can arise due to a variety of factors, including: • Differences in timing among the maturity or repricing of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments • Differences in the amounts of assets, liabilities and off- balance sheet instruments that are maturing or repricing at the same time • Differences in the amounts by which short-term and long- term market interest rates change (for example, changes in the slope of the yield curve) • The impact of changes in the maturity of various assets, liabilities or off-balance sheet instruments as interest rates change The Firm manages interest rate exposure related to its assets and liabilities on a consolidated, Firmwide basis. Business units transfer their interest rate risk to Treasury and CIO through funds transfer pricing, which takes into account the elements of interest rate exposure that can be risk-managed in financial markets. These elements include asset and liability balances and contractual rates of interest, contractual principal payment schedules, expected prepayment experience, interest rate reset dates and maturities, rate indices used for repricing, and any interest rate ceilings or floors for adjustable rate products. Earnings-at-Risk One way that the Firm evaluates its structural interest rate risk is through earnings-at-risk. Earnings-at-risk estimates the Firm’s interest rate exposure for a given interest rate scenario. It is presented as a sensitivity to a baseline, which includes net interest income and certain interest rate sensitive fees. The baseline uses market interest rates and, Management’s discussion and analysis 140 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K in the case of deposits, pricing assumptions. The Firm conducts simulations of changes to this baseline for interest rate-sensitive assets and liabilities denominated in U.S. dollars and other currencies (“non-U.S. dollar” currencies). These simulations primarily include retained loans, deposits, deposits with banks, investment securities, long- term debt and any related interest rate hedges, and funds transfer pricing of other positions in risk management VaR and other sensitivity-based measures as described on page 136. These simulations exclude hedges of exposure from non-U.S. dollar foreign exchange risk arising from the Firm’s capital investments. The inclusion of the hedges in these simulations would increase U.S. dollar sensitivities and decrease non-U.S. dollar sensitivities. Refer to non-U.S. dollar foreign exchange risk on page 145 for more information. Earnings-at-risk scenarios estimate the potential change to a net interest income baseline over the following 12 months utilizing multiple assumptions. These scenarios include a parallel shift involving changes to both short-term and long- term rates by an equal amount; a steeper yield curve involving holding short-term rates constant and increasing long-term rates; and a flatter yield curve involving increasing short-term rates and holding long-term rates constant or holding short-term rates constant and decreasing long-term rates. These scenarios consider many different factors, including: • The impact on exposures as a result of instantaneous changes in interest rates from baseline rates. • Forecasted balance sheet, as well as modeled prepayment and reinvestment behavior, but excluding assumptions about actions that could be taken by the Firm or its clients and customers in response to instantaneous rate changes. Mortgage prepayment assumptions are based on the interest rates used in the scenarios compared with underlying contractual rates, the time since origination, and other factors which are updated periodically based on historical experience. Deposit forecasts are a key assumption in the Firm’s earnings-at-risk. The baseline reflects certain assumptions relating to the reversal of Quantitative Easing that are highly uncertain and require management judgment. Therefore, the actual amount of deposits held by the Firm at any particular time could be impacted by actions the Federal Reserve may take as part of monetary policy, including through the use of the Reverse Repurchase Facility. In addition, there are other factors that impact the amount of deposits held at the Firm such as the level of loans across the industry and competition for deposits. • The pricing sensitivity of deposits, known as deposit betas, represent the amount by which deposit rates paid could change upon a given change in market interest rates. As part of the Firm's continuous evaluation and periodic enhancements to its earnings-at-risk calculations, the Firm updated its model in the second quarter of 2023 to incorporate deposit repricing lags impacting both consumer and wholesale deposits. The model change incorporated observed pricing and customer behavior in both rising and falling interest rate environments. Actual deposit rates paid may differ from the modeled assumptions, primarily due to customer behavior and competition for deposits. The Firm performs sensitivity analyses of the assumptions used in earnings-at-risk scenarios, including with respect to deposit betas and forecasts of deposit balances, both of which are especially significant in the case of consumer deposits. The results of these sensitivity analyses are reported to the CTC Risk Committee and the Board Risk Committee. The Firm’s earnings-at-risk scenarios are periodically evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the composition of the Firm’s balance sheet, changes in market conditions, improvements in the Firm’s simulation and other factors. While a relevant measure of the Firm’s interest rate exposure, the earnings-at-risk analysis does not represent a forecast of the Firm’s net interest income (Refer to Outlook on page 52 for additional information) . The Firm’s U.S. dollar and non-U.S. dollar sensitivities are presented in the table below. December 31, (in billions) 2023 2022 U.S. dollar: (a) Parallel shift: (b) +100 bps shift in rates $ 2.4 $ (2.0) -100 bps shift in rates (2.1) 2.4 +200 bps shift in rates 4.8 (4.2) -200 bps shift in rates (4.6) 3.3 Steeper yield curve: +100 bps shift in long-term rates 0.6 0.8 -100 bps shift in short-term rates (1.5) 3.2 Flatter yield curve: +100 bps shift in short-term rates 1.8 (2.8) -100 bps shift in long-term rates (0.5) (0.9) Non-U.S. dollar: Parallel shift: (b) +100 bps shift in rates $ 0.7 $ 0.7 -100 bps shift in rates (0.7) (0.6) (a) Reflects the impact of the aforementioned model update to incorporate deposit repricing lags. Prior periods have not been revised. (b) Reflects the simultaneous shift of U.S. dollar and non-U.S. dollar rates. In the absence of the model update to incorporate deposit repricing lags in the second quarter of 2023, the Firm's U.S. dollar sensitivities as of December 31, 2023, would have been lower by $4.1 billion to the +100 basis points shift in short-term and parallel rate scenarios and higher by $3.7 billion to the -100 basis points shift in short-term and parallel rate scenarios. The change in the Firm’s U.S. dollar sensitivities as of December 31, 2023 compared to December 31, 2022 also reflected the impact of changes in the Firm’s balance sheet including the impact of the First Republic acquisition. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K 141 As of December 31, 2023, the Firm’s sensitivity to a parallel shift in rates is primarily the result of a greater impact from assets repricing compared to the impact of liabilities repricing. Economic Value Sensitivity In addition to earnings-at-risk, which is measured as a sensitivity to a baseline of earnings over the next 12 months, the Firm also measures Economic Value Sensitivity (“EVS”). EVS stress tests the longer-term economic value of equity by measuring the sensitivity of the Firm’s current balance sheet, primarily retained loans, deposits, debt and investment securities as well as related hedges, under various interest rate scenarios. In accordance with the CTC interest rate risk management policy, the Firm has established limits on EVS as a percentage of TCE. Additional information on long-term debt and held to maturity investment securities is disclosed on page 195 in Note 2 financial instruments that are not carried at fair value on the Consolidated balance sheets. Management’s discussion and analysis 142 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K Non-U.S. dollar foreign exchange risk Non-U.S. dollar FX risk is the risk that changes in foreign exchange rates affect the value of the Firm’s assets or liabilities or future results. The Firm has structural non-U.S. dollar FX exposures arising from capital investments, forecasted expense and revenue, the investment securities portfolio and non-U.S. dollar-denominated debt issuance. Treasury and CIO, working in p artnership with the LOBs, primarily manage these risks on behalf of the Firm. Treasury and CIO may hedge certain of these risks using derivatives. Refer to Business Segment Results on page 66 for additional information. Other sensitivity-based measures The Firm quantifies the market risk of certain debt and equity and credit and funding-related exposures by assessing the potential impact on net revenue, other comprehensive income (“OCI”) and noninterest expense due to changes in relevant market variables. Refer to the predominant business activities that give rise to market risk on page 136 for additional information on the positions captured in other sensitivity-based measures. The table below represents the potential impact to net revenue, OCI or noninterest expense for market risk sensitive instruments that are not included in VaR or earnings-at-risk. Where appropriate, instruments used for hedging purposes are reported net of the positions being hedged. The sensitivities disclosed in the table below may not be representative of the actual gain or loss that would have been realized at December 31, 2023 and 2022, as the movement in market parameters across maturities may vary and are not intended to imply management’s expectation of future changes in these sensitivities.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K 143 Fair value option elected liabilities – interest rate sensitivity COUNTRY RISK MANAGEMENT The Firm, through its LOBs and Corporate, may be exposed to country risk resulting from financial, economic, political or other significant developments which adversely affect the value of the Firm’s exposures related to a particular country or set of countries. The Country Risk Management group actively monitors the various portfolios which may be impacted by these developments and measures the extent to which the Firm’s exposures are diversified given the Firm’s strategy and risk tolerance relative to a country. Organization and management Country Risk Management is an independent risk management function that assesses, manages and monitors exposure to country risk across the Firm. The Firm’s country risk management function includes the following activities: • Maintaining policies, procedures and standards consistent with a comprehensive country risk framework • Assigning sovereign ratings, assessing country risks and establishing risk tolerance relative to a country • Measuring and monitoring country risk exposure and stress across the Firm • Managing and approving country limits and reporting trends and limit breaches to senior management • Developing surveillance tools, such as signaling models and ratings indicators, for early identification of potential country risk concerns • Providing country risk scenario analysis Sources and measurement The Firm is exposed to country risk through its lending and deposits, investing, and market-making activities, whether cross-border or locally funded. Country exposure includes activity with both government and private-sector entities in a country. Under the Firm’s internal country risk management approach, attribution of exposure to an individual country is based on the country where the largest proportion of the assets of the counterparty, issuer, obligor or guarantor are located or where the largest proportion of its revenue is derived, which may be different than the domicile (i.e. legal residence) or country of incorporation. Individual country exposures reflect an aggregation of the Firm’s risk to an immediate default, with zero recovery, of the counterparties, issuers, obligors or guarantors attributed to that country. Activities which result in contingent or indirect exposure to a country are not included in the country exposure measure (for exa mple, providing clearing services or secondary exposure to collateral on securities financing receivables). Assumptions are sometimes required in determining the measurement and allocation of country exposure, particularly in the case of certain non-linear or index products, or where the nature of the counterparty, issuer, obligor or guarantor is not suitable for attribution to an individual country. The use of different measurement approaches or assumptions could affect the amount of reported country exposure. Under the Firm’s internal country risk measurement framework: • Deposits with banks are measured as the cash balances placed with central banks, commercial banks, and other financial institutions • Lending exposures are measured at the total committed amount (funded and unfunded), net of the allowance for credit losses and eligible cash and marketable securities collateral received • Securities financing exposures are measured at their receivable balance, net of eligible collateral received • Debt and equity securities are measured at the fair value of all positions, including both long and short positions • Counterparty exposure on derivative receivables is measured at the derivative’s fair value, net of the fair value of the eligible collateral received • Credit derivatives exposure is measured at the net notional amount of protection purchased or sold for the same underlying reference entity, inclusive of the fair value of the derivative receivable or payable, reflecting the manner in which the Firm manages these exposures The Firm’s internal country risk reporting differs from the reporting provided under the FFIEC bank regulatory requirements. Management’s discussion and analysis 144 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K Stress testing Stress testing is an important component of the Firm’s country risk management framework, which aims to estimate and limit losses arising from a country crisis by measuring the impact of adverse asset price movements to a country based on market shocks combined with counterparty specific assumptions. Country Risk Management periodically designs and runs tailored stress scenarios to test vulnerabilities to individual countries or sets of countries in response to specific or potential market events, sector performance concerns, sovereign actions and geopolitical risks. These tailored stress results are used to inform potential risk reduction across the Firm, as necessary. Risk reporting Country exposure and stress are measured and reported regularly, and used by Country Risk Management to identify trends and monitor high usages and breaches against limits. For country risk management purposes, the Firm may report exposure to jurisdictions that are not fully autonomous, including Special Administrative Regions (“SAR”) and dependent territories, separately from the independent sovereign states with which they are associated. The following table presents the Firm’s top 20 exposures by country (excluding the U.S.) as of December 31, 2023, and their comparative exposures as of December 31, 2022. The top 20 country exposures represent the Firm’s largest total exposures by individual country. Country exposures may fluctuate from period to period due to a variety of factors, including client activity, market flows and liquidity management activities undertaken by the Firm. The decrease in exposure to Japan when compared to December 31, 2022, was driven by a reduction in cash placed with the central bank of Japan as a result of liquidity management activities undertaken by the Firm. The decrease in exposure to Australia when compared to December 31, 2022, was predominantly driven by a reduction in cash placed with the central bank of Australia due to client-driven activities resulting from changes in interest rates. The Firm continues to monitor its exposure to Russia which was approximately $350 million as of December 31, 2023. This amount excludes certain deposits placed on behalf of clients at the Depository Insurance Agency of Russia.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K 145 2023202320232023 CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT Climate risk is the risk associated with the impacts of climate change on the Firm’s clients, customers, operations and business strategy. Climate change is viewed as a driver of risk that may impact existing types of risks managed by the Firm. Climate risk is categorized into physical risk and transition risk. Physical risk refers to economic costs and financial loss associated with a changing climate. Acute physical risk drivers include the increased frequency or severity of climate and weather events, such as floods, wildfires and tropical cyclones. Chronic physical risk drivers include more gradual shifts in the climate, such as sea level rise, persistent changes in precipitation levels and increases in average ambient temperatures. Transition risk refers to the financial and economic implications associated with a societal adjustment to a low- carbon economy. Transition risk drivers include possible changes in public policy, adoption of new technologies and shifts in consumer preferences. Transition risks may also be influenced by changes in the physical climate. Organization and management The Firm has a Climate Risk Management function that is responsible for establishing and maintaining the Firmwide framework and strategy for managing climate risks that may impact the Firm. The Climate Risk Management function engages across the Firm to help integrate climate risk considerations into existing risk management frameworks, as appropriate. Other responsibilities of Climate Risk Management include: • Setting policies, standards, procedures and processes to support identification, escalation, monitoring and management of climate risk across the Firm • Developing metrics, scenarios and stress testing mechanisms designed to assess the range of potential climate-related financial and economic impacts to the Firm • Establishing a Firmwide climate risk data strategy and the supporting climate risk technology infrastructure The LOBs and Corporate are responsible for the identification, assessment and management of climate risks present in their business activities and for adherence to applicable climate-related laws, rules and regulations. Governance and oversight The Firm’s approach to managing climate risk is consistent with the Firm’s risk governance structure. The LOBs and Corporate are responsible for integrating climate risk management into existing governance frameworks, or creating new governance frameworks, as appropriate. The LOBs, Corporate and Climate Risk Management are responsible for providing the Board Risk Committee with information on significant climate risks and climate-related initiatives, as appropriate. Management’s discussion and analysis 146 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT Operational risk is the risk of an adverse outcome resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems; human factors; or external events impacting the Firm’s processes or systems. Operational Risk includes compliance, conduct, legal, and estimations and model risk. Operational risk is inherent in the Firm’s activities and can manifest itself in various ways, including fraudulent acts, business disruptions (including those caused by extraordinary events beyond the Firm's control), cyber attacks, inappropriate employee behavior, failure to comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations or failure of vendors or other third party providers to perform in accordance with their agreements. Operational Risk Management attempts to manage operational risk at appropriate levels in light of the Firm’s financial position, the characteristics of its businesses, and the markets and regulatory environments in which it operates. Operational Risk Management Framework The Firm’s Compliance, Conduct, and Operational Risk (“CCOR”) Management Framework is designed to enable the Firm to govern, identify, measure, monitor and test, manage and report on the Firm’s operational risk. Operational Risk Governance The LOBs and Corporate are responsible for the management of operational risk. The Control Management Organization, which consists of control managers within each LOB and Corporate, is responsible for the day-to-day execution of the CCOR Framework. The Firm’s Global Chief Compliance Officer (“CCO”) and FRE for Operational Risk and Qualitative Risk Appetite is responsible for defining the CCOR Management Framework and establishing the minimum standards for its execution. The LOB and Corporate aligned CCOR Lead Officers report to the Global CCO and FRE for Operational Risk and Qualitative Risk Appetite and are independent of the respective businesses or functions they oversee. The CCOR Management Framework is included in the Risk Governance and Oversight Policy that is reviewed and approved by the Board Risk Committee periodically. Operational Risk Identification The Firm utilizes a structured risk and control self- assessment process that is executed by the LOBs and Corporate. As part of this process, the LOBs and Corporate evaluate the effectiveness of their respective control environment to assess circumstances in which controls have failed, and to determine where remediation efforts may be required. The Firm’s Operational Risk and Compliance organization (“Operational Risk and Compliance”) provides oversight of and challenge to these evaluations and may also perform independent assessments of significant operational risk events and areas of concentrated or emerging risk. Operational Risk Measurement Operational Risk and Compliance performs an independent assessment of the operational risks inherent within the LOBs and Corporate, which includes evaluating the effectiveness of the control environments and reporting the results to senior management. In addition, Operational Risk and Compliance assesses operational risks through quantitative means, including operational risk-based capital and estimation of operational risk losses under both baseline and stressed conditions. The primary component of the operational risk-based capital estimate is the Loss Distribution Approach (“LDA”) statistical model, which simulates the projected frequency and severity of operational risk losses based on historical data. The LDA model is used to estimate an aggregate operational risk loss over a one-year time horizon, at a 99.9% confidence level. The LDA model incorporates actual internal operational risk losses in the quarter following the period in which those losses were realized, and the calculation generally continues to reflect such losses even after the issues or business activities giving rise to the losses have been remediated or reduced. As required under the Basel III capital framework, the Firm’s operational risk capital methodology, which uses the Advanced Measurement Approach (“AMA”), incorporates internal and external losses as well as management’s view of tail risk captured through operational risk scenario analysis, and evaluation of key business environment and internal control metrics. The Firm does not reflect the impact of insurance in its AMA estimate of operational risk capital. The Firm considers the impact of stressed economic conditions on operational risk losses and develops a forward looking view of material operational risk events that may occur in a stressed environment. The Firm’s operational risk stress testing framework is utilized in calculating results for the Firm’s CCAR and other stress testing processes. Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 91-101 for information related to operational risk RWA, and CCAR. Operational Risk Monitoring and testing The results of risk assessments performed by Operational Risk and Compliance are used in connection with their independent monitoring and testing compliance of the LOBs and Corporate with laws, rules and regulations. Through monitoring and testing, Operational Risk and Compliance independently identify areas of heightened operational risk and tests the effectiveness of controls within the LOBs and Corporate. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K 147 Management of Operational Risk The operational risk areas or issues identified through monitoring and testing are escalated to the LOBs and Corporate to be remediated through action plans, as needed, to mitigate operational risk. Operational Risk and Compliance may advise the LOBs and Corporate in the development and implementation of action plans. Operational Risk Reporting All employees of the Firm are expected to escalate risks appropriately. Risks identified by Operational Risk and Compliance are escalated to the appropriate LOB and Corporate Control Committees, as needed. Operational Risk and Compliance has established standards designed to ensure that consistent operational risk reporting and operational risk reports are produced on a Firmwide basis as well as by the LOBs and Corporate. Reporting includes the evaluation of key risk and performance indicators against established thresholds as well as the assessment of different types of operational risk against stated risk appetite. The standards establish escalation protocols to senior management and to the Board of Directors. Insurance One of the ways in which operational risk may be mitigated is through insurance maintained by the Firm. The Firm purchases insurance from commercial insurers and maintains a wholly-owned captive insurer, Park Assurance Company. Insurance may also be required by third parties with whom the Firm does business. Subcategories and examples of operational risks Operational risk can manifest itself in various ways. Operational risk subcategories include Compliance risk, Conduct risk, Legal risk, and Estimations and Model risk. Refer to pages 151, 152, 153 and 154, respectively for more information on Compliance, Conduct, Legal, and Estimations and Model risk. Details on other select examples of operational risks such as business and technology resiliency, payment fraud and third-party outsourcing, as well as cybersecurity, are provided below. War in Ukraine and Sanctions In response to the war in Ukraine, numerous financial and economic sanctions have been imposed on Russia and Russia-associated entities and individuals by various governments around the world, including the authorities in the U.S., U.K. and EU. These sanctions are complex and continue to evolve. The Firm continues to face increased operational and other risks associated with addressing these complex compliance-related matters. To manage this increased risk, the Firm has implemented controls reasonably designed to mitigate the risk of non-compliance and to prevent dealing with sanctioned persons or in property subject to sanctions, as well as to block or restrict payments as required by the applicable regulations. Business and technology resiliency risk Disruptions can occur due to forces beyond the Firm’s control such as the spread of infectious diseases or pandemics, severe weather, natural disasters, the effects of climate change, power or telecommunications loss, failure of a third party to provide expected services, cyberattacks, civil or political unrest or terrorism. The Firmwide Business Resiliency Program is designed to enable the Firm to prepare for, adapt to, withstand and recover from business disruptions including occurrence of extraordinary events beyond its control that may impact critical business functions and supporting assets including staff, technology, facilities and third parties. The program includes governance, awareness training, planning and testing of recovery strategies, as well as strategic and tactical initiatives to identify, assess, and manage business resiliency risks. The program is required to be managed in accordance with the Firm’s overall approach to Operational Risk Management, including alignment with technology, cybersecurity, data, physical security, crisis management, real estate and outsourcing programs. Payment fraud risk Payment fraud risk is the risk of external and internal parties unlawfully obtaining personal monetary benefit through misdirected or otherwise improper payment. The Firm employs various controls for managing payment fraud risk as well as providing employee and client education and awareness trainings. Third-party outsourcing risk The Firm‘s Third-Party Oversight (“TPO”) and Inter-affiliates Oversight (“IAO”) frameworks assist the LOBs and Corporate in selecting, documenting, onboarding, monitoring and managing their supplier relationships including services provided by affiliates. The objectives of the TPO framework are to hold suppliers and other third parties to an appropriate standard of operational performance and to mitigate key risks, including data loss and business disruptions. The Corporate Third-Party Oversight group is responsible for Firmwide training, monitoring, reporting and standards with respect to third- party outsourcing risks. Management’s discussion and analysis 148 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K Cybersecurity risk Cybersecurity risk is the risk of harm or loss resulting from misuse or abuse of technology or the unauthorized disclosure of data. Overview Cybersecurity risk is an important and continuously evolving focus for the Firm. Significant resources are devoted to protecting and enhancing the security of computer systems, software, networks, storage devices, and other technology. The Firm’s security efforts are designed to protect against, among other things, cybersecurity attacks that can result in unauthorized access to confidential information, the destruction of data, disruptions to or degradations of service, the sabotaging of systems or other damage. The Firm has experienced, and expects that it will continue to experience, a higher volume and complexity of cyber attacks against the backdrop of heightened geopolitical tensions. The Firm has implemented measures and controls reasonably designed to address this evolving environment, including enhanced threat monitoring. In addition, the Firm continues to review and enhance its capabilities to address associated risks, such as those relating to the management of administrative access to systems. Third parties with which the Firm does business, that facilitate the Firm’s business activities (e.g., vendors, supply chain, exchanges, clearing houses, central depositories, and financial intermediaries) or that the Firm has acquired are also sources of cybersecurity risk to the Firm. Third party incidents such as system breakdowns or failures, misconduct by the employees of such parties, or cyber attacks, including ransomware and supply-chain compromises, could have a material adverse effect on the Firm, including in circumstances in which an affected third party is unable to deliver a product or service to the Firm or where the incident delivers compromised software to the Firm or results in lost or compromised information of the Firm or its clients or customers. Clients and customers are also sources of cybersecurity risk to the Firm and its information assets, particularly when their activities and systems are beyond the Firm’s own security and control systems. The Firm engages in periodic discussions with its clients, customers and other external parties concerning cybersecurity risks including opportunities to improve cybersecurity. Risks from cybersecurity threats, including any previous cybersecurity events, have not materially affected the Firm or its business strategy, results of operations or financial condition. Notwithstanding the comprehensive approach that the Firm takes to address cybersecurity risk, the Firm may not be successful in preventing or mitigating a future cybersecurity incident that could have a material adverse effect on the Firm or its business strategy, results of operations or financial condition. Organization and management The Global Chief Information Security Officer (“CISO”) reports to the Global Chief Information Officer, and is a member of key cybersecurity governance forums. The CISO leads the Global Cybersecurity and Technology Controls organization, which is responsible for identifying technology and cybersecurity risks and for implementing and maintaining controls to manage cybersecurity threats. The CISO is responsible for the Firm’s Information Security Program, which is designed to prevent, detect and respond to cyber attacks in order to help safeguard the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the Firm's infrastructure, resources and information. The program includes managing the Firm’s global cybersecurity operations centers, providing training, conducting cybersecurity event simulation exercises, implementing the Firm’s policies and standards relating to technology risk and cybersecurity management, and enhancing, as needed, the Firm’s cybersecurity capabilities. The Firm’s Information Security Program includes the following functions: Cyber Operations, which is responsible for implementing and maintaining controls designed to detect and defend the Firm against cyber attacks, and includes a dedicated function for incident response and ongoing monitoring for cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities, including those among the Firm’s third-party suppliers. Technology Governance, Risk & Controls, which is responsible for operationalizing technology risk and control frameworks, analyzing regulatory developments that may impact the Firm, and developing control catalogs and assessments of controls, as well as overseeing governance and reporting of technology and cybersecurity risk. Security Awareness, which provides awareness and training that reinforces information risk and security management practices and compliance with the Firm's policies, standards and practices. The training is mandatory for all employees globally on a periodic basis, and it is supplemented by Firmwide testing initiatives, including periodic phishing tests. The Firm also provides specialized security training to employees in specific roles, such as application developers. The Firm’s Global Privacy Program requires all employees to take periodic training on data privacy that focuses on confidentiality and security, as well as responding to unauthorized access to or use of information. Technology Resiliency, which establishes control requirements for planning and testing the prioritized recovery of technology services in the event of degradation or outage, including incident response planning, data backup and retention, and recovery readiness in support of the Firmwide Business Resiliency Program and operational risk management practices. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K 149 The Firm has a cybersecurity incident response plan designed to enable the Firm to respond to attempted cybersecurity incidents, coordinate as appropriate with law enforcement and other government agencies, notify clients and customers, as applicable, and recover from such incidents. In addition, the Firm actively partners with appropriate government and law enforcement agencies and peer industry forums, participating in discussions and simulations to assist in understanding the full spectrum of cybersecurity risks and in enhancing defenses and improving resiliency in the Firm’s operating environment. Governance and oversight The governance structure for the Global Cybersecurity and Technology Controls organization is designed to appropriately identify, escalate and mitigate cybersecurity risks. Cybersecurity risk management and its governance and oversight are integrated into the Firm’s operational risk management framework, including through the escalation of key risk and control issues to management and the development of risk mitigation plans for heightened risk and control issues. IRM independently assesses and challenges the activities and risk management practices of the Global Cybersecurity and Technology Controls organization related to the identification, assessment, measurement and mitigation of cybersecurity risk. As needed, the Firm engages third-party assessors or auditing firms with industry-recognized expertise on cybersecurity matters to review specific aspects of the Firm’s cybersecurity risk management framework, processes and controls. The governance and oversight for cybersecurity risk management includes governance forums that inform management of key areas of concern regarding the prevention, detection, mitigation and remediation of cybersecurity risks. The Cybersecurity and Technology Controls Operating Committee (“CTOC”) is the principal management committee that oversees the Firm’s assessment and management of cybersecurity risk, including oversight of the implementation and maintenance of appropriate controls in support of the Firm’s Information Security Program. The membership of the CTOC includes senior representatives from the Global Cybersecurity and Technology Controls organization and relevant corporate functions, including IRM and Internal Audit. CTOC members have extensive experience and qualifications in various technology and information security disciplines, including relevant experience at the Firm, at other financial services companies or in other highly-regulated industries. The CTOC escalates key operational risk and control issues, as appropriate, to the Global Technology Operating Committee (“GTOC”) or its business control committee or to the appropriate LOB and Corporate Control Committees. The GTOC is responsible for the governance of the Firmwide Global Technology organization, including oversight of Firmwide technology strategies, the delivery of technology and technology operations, the effective use of information technology resources, and monitoring and resolving key operational risk and control matters arising in the Global Technology organization. As part of its oversight of management’s implementation and maintenance of the Firm’s risk management framework, the Firm’s Board of Directors receives periodic updates from the CIO, the CISO and senior members of the CTOC concerning cybersecurity matters. These updates generally include information regarding cybersecurity and technology developments, the Firm’s Information Security Program and recommended changes to that program, cybersecurity policies and practices, and ongoing initiatives to improve information security, as well as any significant cybersecurity incidents and the Firm's efforts to address those incidents. The Audit Committee and the Risk Committee assist the Board in this oversight. Management’s discussion and analysis 150 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K COMPLIANCE RISK MANAGEMENT Compliance risk, a subcategory of operational risk, is the risk of failing to comply with laws, rules, regulations or codes of conduct and standards of self-regulatory organizations. Overview Each of the LOBs and Corporate hold primary ownership of and accountability for managing their compliance risk. The Firm’s Operational Risk and Compliance Organization (“Operational Risk and Compliance”), which is independent of the LOBs and Corporate, provides independent review, monitoring and oversight of business operations with a focus on compliance with the laws, rules, and regulations applicable to the delivery of the Firm’s products and services to clients and customers. These compliance risks relate to a wide variety of laws, rules and regulations across the LOBs and Corporate, and jurisdictions, and include risks related to financial products and services, relationships and interactions with clients and customers, and employee activities. For example, compliance risks include those associated with anti-money laundering compliance, trading activities, market conduct, and complying with the laws, rules, and regulations related to the offering of products and services across jurisdictional borders. Compliance risk is also inherent in the Firm’s fiduciary activities, including the failure to exercise the applicable standard of care to act in the best interest of fiduciary clients and customers or to treat fiduciary clients and customers fairly. Other functions provide oversight of significant regulatory obligations that are specific to their respective areas of responsibility. Operational Risk and Compliance implements policies and standards designed to govern, identify, measure, monitor and test, manage, and report on compliance risk. Governance and oversight Operational Risk and Compliance is led by the Firm’s Global CCO and FRE for Operational Risk and Qualitative Risk Appetite. The Firm maintains oversight and coordination of its compliance risk through the CCOR Management Framework. The Firm’s Global CCO and FRE for Operational Risk and Qualitative Risk Appetite also provides regular updates to the Board Risk Committee and the Audit Committee on significant compliance risk issues, as appropriate. Code of Conduct The Firm has a Code of Conduct (the “Code”) that sets forth the Firm’s expectation that employees will conduct themselves with integrity, at all times. The Code provides the principles that help govern employee conduct with clients, customers, suppliers, vendors, shareholders, regulators, other employees, as well as with the markets and communities in which the Firm operates. The Code requires employees to promptly report any potential or actual violation of the Code, any Firm policy, or any law or regulation applicable to the Firm’s business. It also requires employees to report any illegal or unethical conduct, or conduct that violates the underlying principles of the Code, by any of the Firm’s employees, consultants, clients, customers, suppliers, contract or temporary workers, or business partners or agents. Training is assigned to newly hired employees upon joining the Firm, and to current employees periodically thereafter. Employees are required to affirm their compliance with the Code annually. Employees can report any potential or actual violations of the Code through the Firm’s Conduct Hotline (the “Hotline”) by phone or the internet. The Hotline is anonymous, where permitted by law, and is available at all times globally, with translation services and is administered by an outside service provider. The Code prohibits retaliation against anyone who raises an issue or concern in good faith or assists with an inquiry or investigation. Periodically, the Audit Committee receives reports on the Code of Conduct program. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K 151 CONDUCT RISK MANAGEMENT Conduct risk, a subcategory of operational risk, is the risk that any action or misconduct by an employee could lead to unfair client or customer outcomes, impact the integrity of the markets in which the Firm operates, harm employees or the Firm, or compromise the Firm’s reputation. Overview Each LOB and Corporate is accountable for identifying and managing its conduct risk to provide appropriate engagement, ownership and sustainability of a culture consistent with the Firm’s Business Principles. The Business Principles serve as a guide for how employees are expected to conduct themselves. With the Business Principles serving as a guide, the Firm’s Code sets out the Firm’s expectations for each employee and provides information and resources to help employees conduct business ethically and in compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations everywhere the Firm operates. Refer to Compliance Risk Management on page 151 for further discussion of the Code. Governance and oversight The Firm maintains oversight and coordination of its conduct risk through the CCOR Management Framework. The Firm has a senior forum that provides oversight of the Firm’s conduct initiatives to develop a more holistic view of conduct risks and to connect key programs across the Firm in order to identify opportunities and emerging areas of focus. This forum is responsible for setting overall program direction for strategic enhancements to the Firm's employee conduct framework and reviewing the consolidated Firmwide Conduct Risk Appetite Assessment. Conduct risk management encompasses various aspects of people management practices throughout the employee life cycle, including recruiting, onboarding, training and development, performance management, promotion and compensation processes. Each LOB, Treasury and CIO, and each designated corporate function completes an assessment of conduct risk periodically, reviews metrics and issues which may involve conduct risk, and provides conduct education as appropriate. Management’s discussion and analysis 152 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K LEGAL RISK MANAGEMENT Legal risk, a subcategory of operational risk, is the risk of loss primarily caused by the actual or alleged failure to meet legal obligations that arise from the rule of law in jurisdictions in which the Firm operates, agreements with clients and customers, and products and services offered by the Firm. Overview The global Legal function (“Legal”) provides legal services and advice to the Firm. Legal is responsible for managing the Firm’s exposure to legal risk by: • managing actual and potential litigation and enforcement matters, including internal reviews and investigations related to such matters • advising on products and services, including contract negotiation and documentation • advising on offering and marketing documents and new business initiatives • managing dispute resolution • interpreting existing laws, rules and regulations, and advising on changes to them • advising on advocacy in connection with contemplated and proposed laws, rules and regulations, and • providing legal advice to the LOBs, Corporate and the Board. Legal selects, engages and manages outside counsel for the Firm on all matters in which outside counsel is engaged. In addition, Legal advises the Firm’s Conflicts Office which reviews the Firm’s wholesale transactions that may have the potential to create conflicts of interest for the Firm. Governance and oversight The Firm’s General Counsel reports to the CEO and is a member of the Operating Committee, the Firmwide Risk Committee and the Firmwide Control Committee. The Firm’s General Counsel and other members of Legal report on significant legal matters to the Firm’s Board of Directors and to the Audit Committee. Legal serves on and advises various committees and advises the Firm’s LOBs and Corporate on potential reputation risk issues. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K 153 ESTIMATIONS AND MODEL RISK MANAGEMENT Estimations and Model risk, a subcategory of operational risk, is the potential for adverse consequences from decisions based on incorrect or misused estimation outputs. The Firm uses models and other analytical and judgment- based estimations across various businesses and functions. The estimation methods are of varying levels of sophistication and are used for many purposes, such as the valuation of positions and measurement of risk, assessing regulatory capital requirements, conducting stress testing, evaluating the allowance for credit losses and making business decisions. A dedicated independent function, Model Risk Governance and Review (“MRGR”), defines and governs the Firm’s policies relating to the management of model risk and risks associated with certain analytical and judgment-based estimations, such as those used in risk management, budget forecasting and capital planning and analysis. The governance of analytical and judgment-based estimations within MRGR’s scope follows a consistent approach which is used for models, as described in detail below. Model risks are owned by the users of the models within the LOBs and Corporate based on the specific purposes of such models. Users and developers of models are responsible for developing, implementing and testing their models, as well as referring models to MRGR for review and approval. Once models have been approved, model users and developers are responsible for maintaining a robust operating environment, and must monitor and evaluate the performance of the models on an ongoing basis. Model users and developers may seek to enhance models in response to changes in the relevant portfolios and in product and market developments, as well as to capture improvements in available modeling techniques and systems capabilities. Models are tiered based on an internal standard according to their complexity, the exposure associated with the model and the Firm’s reliance on the model. This tiering is subject to the approval of MRGR. In its review of a model, MRGR considers whether the model is suitable for the specific purposes for which it will be used. When reviewing a model, MRGR analyzes and challenges the model methodology and the reasonableness of model assumptions, and may perform or require additional testing, including back-testing of model outcomes. Model reviews are approved by the appropriate level of management within MRGR based on the relevant model tier. Under the Firm’s Estimations and Model Risk Management Policy, MRGR reviews and approves new models, as well as material changes to existing models, prior to their use. In certain circumstances, exceptions may be granted to the Firm’s policy to allow a model to be used prior to review or approval. MRGR may also require the user to take appropriate actions to mitigate the model risk if it is to be used in the interim. These actions will depend on the model and may include, for example, limitation of trading activity. While models are inherently imprecise, the degree of imprecision or uncertainty can be heightened by the market or economic environment. This is particularly true when the current and forecasted environments are significantly different from the historical environments upon which the models were developed. This increased uncertainty may necessitate a greater degree of judgment and analytics to inform any adjustments that the Firm may make to model outputs than would otherwise be the case. In addition, the Firm may experience increased uncertainty in its estimates if assets acquired differ from those used to develop the models. Refer to Critical Accounting Estimates Used by the Firm on pages 155–158 and Note 2 for a summary of model-based valuations and other valuation techniques. Management’s discussion and analysis 154 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRM JPMorgan Chase’s accounting policies and use of estimates are integral to understanding its reported results. The Firm’s most complex accounting estimates require management’s judgment to ascertain the appropriate carrying value of assets and liabilities. The Firm has established policies and control procedures intended to ensure that estimation methods, including any judgments made as part of such methods, are well-controlled, independently reviewed and applied consistently from period to period. The methods used and judgments made reflect, among other factors, the nature of the assets or liabilities and the related business and risk management strategies, which may vary across the Firm’s businesses and portfolios. In addition, the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. The Firm believes its estimates for determining the carrying value of its assets and liabilities are appropriate. The following is a brief description of the Firm’s critical accounting estimates involving significant judgments. Allowance for credit losses The Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents management’s estimate of expected credit losses over the remaining expected life of the Firm’s financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. The allowance for credit losses generally comprises: • The allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated), • The allowance for lending-related commitments and • The allowance for credit losses on investment securities. The allowance for credit losses involves significant judgment on a number of matters including development and weighting of macroeconomic forecasts, incorporation of historical loss experience, assessment of risk characteristics, assignment of risk ratings, valuation of collateral, and the determination of remaining expected life. Refer to Note 10 and Note 13 for further information on these judgments as well as the Firm’s policies and methodologies used to determine the Firm’s allowance for credit losses. One of the most significant judgments involved in estimating the Firm’s allowance for credit losses relates to the macroeconomic forecasts used to estimate credit losses over the eight-quarter forecast period within the Firm’s methodology. The eight-quarter forecast incorporates hundreds of macroeconomic variables (“MEVs”) that are relevant for exposures across the Firm, with modeled credit losses being driven primarily by a subset of less than twenty variables. The specific variables that have the greatest effect on the modeled losses of each portfolio vary by portfolio and geography. • Key MEVs for the consumer portfolio include regional U.S. unemployment rates and U.S. HPI. • Key MEVs for the wholesale portfolio include U.S. unemployment, U.S. real GDP, U.S. equity prices, U.S. interest rates, U.S. corporate credit spreads, oil prices, U.S. commercial real estate prices and U.S. HPI. Changes in the Firm’s assumptions and forecasts of economic conditions could significantly affect its estimate of expected credit losses in the portfolio at the balance sheet date or lead to significant changes in the estimate from one reporting period to the next. As a result of the First Republic acquisition, the Firm recorded an allowance for credit losses for the loans acquired and lending-related commitments assumed as of May 1, 2023. Given the differences in risk rating methodologies for the First Republic portfolio, and the ongoing integration of products and systems, the allowance for credit losses for the acquired wholesale portfolio was measured based on other facilities underwritten by the Firm with similar risk characteristics and not based on modeled estimates. As such, the First Republic wholesale portfolio is excluded from the modeled estimates sensitivity analysis below. The allowance for credit losses for predominantly all of the consumer portfolio was measured using the Firm’s modeled approach, as the consumer portfolio is predominantly residential real estate that has more commonly defined risk characteristics including loan to value ratio and credit score, and therefore is reflected in the sensitivity analysis below. Refer to Note 34 for additional information on the First Republic acquisition. It is difficult to estimate how potential changes in any one factor or input might affect the overall allowance for credit losses because management considers a wide variety of factors and inputs in estimating the allowance for credit losses. Changes in the factors and inputs considered may not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across all geographies or product types, and changes in factors and inputs may be directionally inconsistent, such that improvement in one factor or input may offset deterioration in others. To consider the impact of a hypothetical alternate macroeconomic forecast, the Firm compared the modeled credit losses determined using its central and relative adverse macroeconomic scenarios, which are two of the five scenarios considered in estimating the allowances for loan losses and lending-related commitments. The central and relative adverse scenarios each included a full suite of MEVs, but differed in the levels, paths and peaks/troughs of those variables over the eight-quarter forecast period. For example, compared to the Firm’s central scenario shown on page 131 and in Note 13, the Firm’s relative adverse scenario assumes an elevated U.S. unemployment rate, averaging approximately 2.1% higher over the eight- quarter forecast, with a peak difference of approximately 2.7% in the fourth quarter of 2024; lower U.S. real GDP with a slower recovery, remaining nearly 3.3% lower at the end of the eight-quarter forecast, with a peak difference of JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K 155 approximately 3.9% in the fourth quarter of 2024; and lower HPI with a peak difference of approximately 17.9% in the third quarter of 2025. This analysis is not intended to estimate expected future changes in the allowance for credit losses, for a number of reasons, including: • The allowance as of December 31, 2023, reflects credit losses beyond those estimated under the central scenario due to the weight placed on the adverse scenarios. • The impacts of changes in many MEVs are both interrelated and nonlinear, so the results of this analysis cannot be simply extrapolated for more severe changes in macroeconomic variables. • Expectations of future changes in portfolio composition and borrower behavior can significantly affect the allowance for credit losses. To demonstrate the sensitivity of credit loss estimates to macroeconomic forecasts as of December 31, 2023, the Firm compared the modeled estimates under its relative adverse scenario to its central scenario. Without considering offsetting or correlated effects in other qualitative components of the Firm’s allowance for credit losses, the comparison between these two scenarios for the exposures below reflect the following differences: • An increase of approximately $850 million for residential real estate loans and lending-related commitments • An increase of approximately $3.1 billion for credit card loans • An increase of approximately $3.9 billion for wholesale loans and lending-related commitments This analysis relates only to the modeled credit loss estimates and is not intended to estimate changes in the overall allowance for credit losses as it does not reflect any potential changes in other adjustments to the quantitative calculation, which would also be influenced by the judgment management applies to the modeled lifetime loss estimates to reflect the uncertainty and imprecision of these modeled lifetime loss estimates based on then-current circumstances and conditions. Recognizing that forecasts of macroeconomic conditions are inherently uncertain, the Firm believes that its process to consider the available information and associated risks and uncertainties is appropriately governed and that its estimates of expected credit losses were reasonable and appropriate for the period ended December 31, 2023. Fair value JPMorgan Chase carries a portion of its assets and liabilities at fair value. The majority of such assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, including derivatives, structured note products and certain securities financing agreements. Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, including certain mortgage, home equity and other loans, where the carrying value is based on the fair value of the underlying collateral. Assets measured at fair value The following table includes the Firm’s assets measured at fair value and the portion of such assets that are classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Refer to Note 2 for further information. December 31, 2023 (in millions, except ratios) Total assets at fair value Total level 3 assets Federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements $ 259,813 $ — Securities borrowed 70,086 — Trading assets: Trading-debt and equity instruments 485,701 2,373 Derivative receivables(a) 54,864 8,924 Total trading assets 540,565 11,297 AFS securities 201,704 — Loans 38,851 3,079 MSRs 8,522 8,522 Other 11,322 758 Total assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis 1,130,863 23,656 Total assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis 3,141 2,490 Total assets measured at fair value $ 1,134,004 $ 26,146 Total Firm assets $ 3,875,393 Level 3 assets at fair value as a percentage of total Firm assets(a) 1% Level 3 assets at fair value as a percentage of total Firm assets at fair value(a) 2% (a) For purposes of the table above, the derivative receivables total reflects the impact of netting adjustments; however, the $8.9 billion of derivative receivables classified as level 3 does not reflect the netting adjustment as such netting is not relevant to a presentation based on the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset. The level 3 balances would be reduced if netting were applied, including the netting benefit associated with cash collateral. Management’s discussion and analysis 156 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K Valuation Details of the Firm’s processes for determining fair value are set out in Note 2. Estimating fair value requires the application of judgment. The type and level of judgment required is largely dependent on the amount of observable market information available to the Firm. For instruments valued using internally developed valuation models and other valuation techniques that use significant unobservable inputs and are therefore classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, judgments used to estimate fair value are more significant than those required when estimating the fair value of instruments classified within levels 1 and 2. In arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument within level 3, management must first determine the appropriate valuation model or other valuation technique to use. Second, the lack of observability of certain significant inputs requires management to assess relevant empirical data in deriving valuation inputs including, for example, transaction details, yield curves, interest rates, prepayment speeds, default rates, volatilities, correlations, prices (such as commodity, equity or debt prices), valuations of comparable instruments, foreign exchange rates and credit curves. Refer to Note 2 for a further discussion of the valuation of level 3 instruments, including unobservable inputs used. For instruments classified in levels 2 and 3, management judgment must be applied to assess the appropriate level of valuation adjustments to reflect counterparty credit quality, the Firm’s creditworthiness, market funding rates, liquidity considerations, unobservable parameters, and for portfolios that meet specified criteria, the size of the net open risk position. The judgments made are typically affected by the type of product and its specific contractual terms, and the level of liquidity for the product or within the market as a whole. In periods of heightened market volatility and uncertainty judgments are further affected by the wider variation of reasonable valuation estimates, particularly for positions that are less liquid. Refer to Note 2 for a further discussion of valuation adjustments applied by the Firm. Imprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs or other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss recorded for a particular position. Furthermore, while the Firm believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with those of other market participants, the methods and assumptions used reflect management judgment and may vary across the Firm’s businesses and portfolios. The Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in the determination of fair value. The use of methodologies or assumptions different than those used by the Firm could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. Refer to Note 2 for a detailed discussion of the Firm’s valuation process and hierarchy, and its determination of fair value for individual financial instruments. Goodwill impairment Under U.S. GAAP, goodwill must be allocated to reporting units and tested for impairment at least annually. The Firm’s process and methodology used to conduct goodwill impairment testing is described in Note 15. Management applies significant judgment when testing goodwill for impairment. The goodwill associated with each business combination is allocated to the related reporting units for goodwill impairment testing. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Firm reviewed current economic conditions, estimated market cost of equity, as well as actual business results and projections of business performance. Based on such reviews, the Firm has concluded that goodwill was not impaired as of December 31, 2023. For each of the reporting units, fair value exceeded carrying value by at least 9% and there was no indication of a significant risk of goodwill impairment based on current projections and valuations. The projections for the Firm’s reporting units are consistent with management’s current business outlook assumptions in the short term, and the Firm’s best estimates of long- term growth and return on equity in the longer term. Where possible, the Firm uses third-party and peer data to benchmark its assumptions and estimates. Refer to Note 15 for additional information on goodwill, including the goodwill impairment assessment as of December 31, 2023. Credit card rewards liability JPMorgan Chase offers credit cards with various rewards programs which allow cardholders to earn rewards points based on their account activity and the terms and conditions of the rewards program. Generally, there are no limits on the points that an eligible cardholder can earn, nor do the points expire, and the points can be redeemed for a variety of rewards, including cash (predominantly in the form of account credits), gift cards and travel. The Firm maintains a rewards liability which represents the estimated cost of rewards points earned and expected to be redeemed by cardholders. The liability is accrued as the cardholder earns the benefit and is reduced when the cardholder redeems points. This liability was $13.2 billion and $11.3 billion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and is recorded in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets. The increase in the liability was predominantly driven by continued growth in rewards points earned on higher spend and promotional offers outpacing redemptions throughout 2023, and, to a lesser extent, adjustments to certain reward program terms in the second quarter of 2023. The rewards liability is sensitive to redemption rate (“RR”) and cost per point (“CPP”) assumptions. The RR assumption is used to estimate the number of points earned by customers that will be redeemed over the life of the account. The CPP assumption is used to estimate the cost of future point redemptions. These assumptions are evaluated periodically considering historical actuals, cardholder JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K 157 redemption behavior and management judgment. Updates to these assumptions will impact the rewards liability. As of December 31, 2023, a combined increase of 25 basis points in RR and 1 basis point in CPP would increase the rewards liability by approximately $376 million. Income taxes JPMorgan Chase is subject to the income tax laws of the various jurisdictions in which it operates, including U.S. federal, state and local, and non-U.S. jurisdictions. These laws are often complex and may be subject to different interpretations. To determine the financial statement impact of accounting for income taxes, including the provision for income tax expense and unrecognized tax benefits, JPMorgan Chase must make assumptions and judgments about how to interpret and apply these complex tax laws to numerous transactions and business events, as well as make judgments regarding the timing of when certain items may affect taxable income in the U.S. and non-U.S. tax jurisdictions. JPMorgan Chase’s interpretations of tax laws around the world are subject to review and examination by the various taxing authorities in the jurisdictions where the Firm operates, and disputes may occur regarding its view on a tax position. These disputes over interpretations with the various taxing authorities may be settled by audit, administrative appeals or adjudication in the court systems of the tax jurisdictions in which the Firm operates. JPMorgan Chase regularly reviews whether it may be assessed additional income taxes as a result of the resolution of these matters, and the Firm records additional unrecognized tax benefits, as appropriate. In addition, the Firm may revise its estimate of income taxes due to changes in income tax laws, legal interpretations, and business strategies. It is possible that revisions in the Firm’s estimate of income taxes may materially affect the Firm’s results of operations in any reporting period. Deferred taxes arise from differences between assets and liabilities measured for financial reporting versus income tax return purposes. Deferred tax assets are recognized if, in management’s judgment, their realizability is determined to be more likely than not. Deferred taxes are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized within the provision for income taxes in the period enacted. The Firm has also recognized deferred tax assets in connection with certain tax attributes, including net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards and foreign tax credit (“FTC”) carryforwards. The Firm performs regular reviews to ascertain whether its deferred tax assets are realizable. These reviews include management’s estimates and assumptions regarding future taxable income, including foreign source income, and may incorporate various tax planning strategies, including strategies that may be available to utilize NOLs and FTCs before they expire. In connection with these reviews, if it is determined that a deferred tax asset is not realizable, a valuation allowance is established. The valuation allowance may be reversed in a subsequent reporting period if the Firm determines that, based on revised estimates of future taxable income or changes in tax planning strategies, it is more likely than not that all or part of the deferred tax asset will become realizable. As of December 31, 2023, management has determined it is more likely than not that the Firm will realize its deferred tax assets, net of the existing valuation allowance. The Firm adjusts its unrecognized tax benefits as necessary when new information becomes available, including changes in tax law and regulations, and interactions with taxing authorities. Uncertain tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize. An uncertain tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that management believes is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement. It is possible that the reassessment of JPMorgan Chase’s unrecognized tax benefits may have a material impact on its effective income tax rate in the period in which the reassessment occurs. Although the Firm believes that its estimates are reasonable, the final tax amount could be different from the amounts reflected in the Firm’s income tax provisions and accruals. To the extent that the final outcome of these amounts is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will generally impact the Firm’s provision for income taxes in the period in which such a determination is made. The Firm’s provision for income taxes is composed of current and deferred taxes. The current and deferred tax provisions are calculated based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year. Adjustments based on filed returns are generally recorded in the period when the tax returns are filed and the global tax implications are known, which could impact the Firm’s effective tax rate. Refer to Note 25 for additional information on income taxes. Litigation reserves Refer to Note 30 for a description of the significant estimates and judgments associated with establishing litigation reserves.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K 161 Management of JPMorgan Chase & Co. (“JPMorgan Chase” or the “Firm”) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Firm’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by JPMorgan Chase’s Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). JPMorgan Chase’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records, that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Firm’s assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the Firm are being made only in accordance with authorizations of JPMorgan Chase’s management and directors; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Firm’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management has completed an assessment of the effectiveness of the Firm’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023. In making the assessment, management used the “Internal Control — Integrated Framework” (“COSO 2013”) promulgated by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). Based upon the assessment performed, management concluded that as of December 31, 2023, JPMorgan Chase’s internal control over financial reporting was effective based upon the COSO 2013 framework. Additionally, based upon management’s assessment, the Firm determined that there were no material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023. The effectiveness of the Firm’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein. James Dimon Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Jeremy Barnum Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer February 16, 2024 Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 162 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of JPMorgan Chase & Co.: Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries (the “Firm”) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Firm’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Firm as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Firm maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. Basis for Opinions The Firm’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Firm’s consolidated financial statements and on the Firm’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Firm in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP  300 Madison Avenue  New York, NY 10017 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K 163 Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. Allowance for Loan Losses – Portfolio-based component of Wholesale Loan and Credit Card Loan Portfolios As described in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements, the allowance for loan losses for the portfolio- based component of the wholesale and credit card loan portfolios was $20.2 billion on total portfolio-based retained loans of $881.3 billion at December 31, 2023. The Firm’s allowance for loan losses represents management’s estimate of expected credit losses over the remaining expected life of the Firm's loan portfolios and considers expected future changes in macroeconomic conditions. The portfolio-based component of the Firm’s allowance for loan losses for the wholesale and credit card retained loan portfolios begins with a quantitative calculation of expected credit losses over the expected life of the loan by applying credit loss factors to the estimated exposure at default. The credit loss factors applied are determined based on the weighted average of five internally developed macroeconomic scenarios that take into consideration the Firm's economic outlook as derived through forecast macroeconomic variables, the most significant of which are U.S. unemployment and U.S. real gross domestic product. This quantitative calculation is further adjusted to take into consideration model imprecision, emerging risk assessments, trends and other subjective factors that are not yet otherwise reflected in the credit loss estimate. The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the allowance for loan losses for the portfolio-based component of the wholesale and credit card loan portfolios is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment and estimation by management in the forecast of macroeconomic variables, specifically U.S. unemployment and U.S. real gross domestic product, as the Firm’s forecasts of economic conditions significantly affect its estimate of expected credit losses at the balance sheet date, (ii) the significant judgment and estimation by management in determining the quantitative calculation utilized in their credit loss estimates and the adjustments to take into consideration model imprecision, emerging risk assessments, trends and other subjective factors that are not yet otherwise reflected in the credit loss estimate, which both in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and in evaluating audit evidence obtained relating to the credit loss estimates and the appropriateness of the adjustments to the credit loss estimates, and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the Firm’s allowance for loan losses, including controls over model validation and generation of macroeconomic scenarios. These procedures also included, among others, testing management’s process for estimating the allowance for loan losses, which involved (i) evaluating the appropriateness of the models and methodologies used in quantitative calculations; (ii) evaluating the reasonableness of forecasts of U.S. unemployment and U.S. real gross domestic product; (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of data used in the estimate; and (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of management’s adjustments to the quantitative output for the impacts of model imprecision, emerging risk assessments, trends and other subjective factors that are not yet otherwise reflected in the credit loss estimate. These procedures also included the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in evaluating the appropriateness of certain models, methodologies and macroeconomic variables. Fair Value of Certain Level 3 Financial Instruments As described in Notes 2 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Firm carries $1.1 trillion of its assets and $541.4 billion of its liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis. Included in these balances are $11.3 billion of trading assets and $42.2 billion of liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, collectively financial instruments, which are classified as level 3 as they contain one or more inputs to valuation which are unobservable and significant to their fair value measurement. The Firm utilized internally developed valuation models and unobservable inputs to estimate fair value of the level 3 financial instruments. The unobservable inputs used by management to estimate the fair value of certain of these financial instruments include interest rate volatility, interest rate spread volatility, Bermudan switch value, and correlation relating to interest rates, interest rate-to- foreign exchange, equity prices, equity-to-foreign exchange, equity-to-interest rate and credit. The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the fair value of certain level 3 financial instruments is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment and estimation by management in determining the inputs to estimate fair value, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and in evaluating audit evidence obtained related to the fair value of these financial instruments, and (ii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 164 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the Firm’s determination of the fair value, including controls over models, inputs, and data. These procedures also included, among others, the involvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in developing an independent estimate of fair value for a sample of these financial instruments and comparing management’s estimate to the independently developed estimate of fair value. Developing the independent estimate involved testing the completeness and accuracy of data provided by management, developing independent inputs and, as appropriate, evaluating and utilizing management’s aforementioned unobservable inputs.

JPMorgan Chase & Co. Consolidated statements of cash flows 170 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K Note 1 – Basis of presentation JPMorgan Chase & Co. (“JPMorgan Chase” or the “Firm”), a financial holding company incorporated under Delaware law in 1968, is a leading financial services firm based in the U.S., with operations worldwide. The Firm is a leader in investment banking, financial services for consumers and small businesses, commercial banking, financial transaction processing and asset management. On May 1, 2023, JPMorgan Chase acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of First Republic Bank (the “First Republic acquisition”) from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”). The Firm continues to convert certain operations, and to integrate clients, products and services associated with the First Republic acquisition, to align with the Firm’s businesses and operations. Accordingly, reporting classification and internal risk rating profiles in the wholesale portfolio may change in future periods. Refer to Note 34 for additional information on the First Republic acquisition. The accounting and financial reporting policies of JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries conform to U.S. GAAP. Additionally, where applicable, the policies conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by regulatory authorities. Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of JPMorgan Chase and other entities in which the Firm has a controlling financial interest. All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Assets held for clients in an agency or fiduciary capacity by the Firm are not assets of JPMorgan Chase and are not included on the Consolidated balance sheets. The Firm determines whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity or a variable interest entity. Voting interest entities Voting interest entities are entities that have sufficient equity and provide the equity investors voting rights that enable them to make significant decisions relating to the entity’s operations. For these types of entities, the Firm’s determination of whether it has a controlling interest is primarily based on the amount of voting equity interests held. Entities in which the Firm has a controlling financial interest, through ownership of the majority of the entities’ voting equity interests, or through other contractual rights that give the Firm control, are consolidated by the Firm. Investments in companies in which the Firm has significant influence over operating and financing decisions (but does not own a majority of the voting equity interests) are accounted for (i) in accordance with the equity method of accounting, or (ii) at fair value if the fair value option was elected. These investments are generally included in other assets, with income or loss included in noninterest revenue. Certain Firm-sponsored asset management funds are structured as limited partnerships or limited liability companies. For many of these entities, the Firm is the general partner or managing member, but the non- affiliated partners or members have the ability to remove the Firm as the general partner or managing member without cause (i.e., kick-out rights), based on a simple majority vote, or the non-affiliated partners or members have rights to participate in important decisions. Accordingly, the Firm does not consolidate these voting interest entities. However, in the limited cases where the non-managing partners or members do not have substantive kick-out or participating rights, the Firm evaluates the funds as VIEs and consolidates the funds if the Firm is the general partner or managing member and has both power and a potentially significant interest. The Firm’s investment companies and asset management funds have investments in both publicly-held and privately- held entities, including investments in buyouts, growth equity and venture opportunities. These investments are accounted for under investment company guidelines and, accordingly, irrespective of the percentage of equity ownership interests held, are carried on the Consolidated balance sheets at fair value, and are recorded in other assets, with income or loss included in noninterest revenue. If consolidated, the Firm retains the accounting under such specialized investment company guidelines. Variable interest entities VIEs are entities that, by design, either (1) lack sufficient equity to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties, or (2) have equity investors that do not have the ability to make significant decisions relating to the entity’s operations through voting rights, or do not have the obligation to absorb the expected losses, or do not have the right to receive the residual returns of the entity. The most common type of VIE is an SPE. SPEs are commonly used in securitization transactions in order to isolate certain assets and distribute the cash flows from those assets to investors. The basic SPE structure involves a company selling assets to the SPE; the SPE funds the purchase of those assets by issuing securities to investors. The legal documents that govern the transaction specify how the cash earned on the assets must be allocated to the SPE’s investors and other parties that have rights to those cash flows. SPEs are generally structured to insulate investors from claims on the SPE’s assets by creditors of other entities, including the creditors of the seller of the assets. The primary beneficiary of a VIE (i.e., the party that has a controlling financial interest) is required to consolidate the assets and liabilities of the VIE. The primary beneficiary is the party that has both (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance; and (2) through its interests in the VIE, the Notes to consolidated financial statements JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K 171 obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. To assess whether the Firm has the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance, the Firm considers all the facts and circumstances, including its role in establishing the VIE and its ongoing rights and responsibilities. This assessment includes, first, identifying the activities that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance; and second, identifying which party, if any, has power over those activities. In general, the parties that make the most significant decisions affecting the VIE (such as asset managers, collateral managers, servicers, or owners of call options or liquidation rights over the VIE’s assets) or have the right to unilaterally remove those decision-makers are deemed to have the power to direct the activities of a VIE. To assess whether the Firm has the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE, the Firm considers all of its economic interests, including debt and equity investments, servicing fees, and derivatives or other arrangements deemed to be variable interests in the VIE. This assessment requires that the Firm apply judgment in determining whether these interests, in the aggregate, are considered potentially significant to the VIE. Factors considered in assessing significance include: the design of the VIE, including its capitalization structure; subordination of interests; payment priority; relative share of interests held across various classes within the VIE’s capital structure; and the reasons why the interests are held by the Firm. The Firm performs on-going reassessments of: (1) whether entities previously evaluated under the majority voting- interest framework have become VIEs, based on certain events, and are therefore subject to the VIE consolidation framework; and (2) whether changes in the facts and circumstances regarding the Firm’s involvement with a VIE cause the Firm’s consolidation conclusion to change. Refer to Note 14 for further discussion of Firm-sponsored VIEs. Revenue recognition Interest income The Firm recognizes interest income on loans, debt securities, and other debt instruments, generally on a level- yield basis, based on the underlying contractual rate. Refer to Note 7 for further information. Revenue from contracts with customers JPMorgan Chase recognizes noninterest revenue from certain contracts with customers, in investment banking fees, deposit-related fees, asset management fees, commissions and other fees, and components of card income, when the Firm’s related performance obligations are satisfied. Refer to Note 6 for further discussion of the Firm’s revenue from contracts with customers. Principal transactions revenue JPMorgan Chase carries a portion of its assets and liabilities at fair value. Changes in fair value are reported primarily in principal transactions revenue. Refer to Notes 2 and 3 for further discussion of fair value measurement. Refer to Note 6 for further discussion of principal transactions revenue. Use of estimates in the preparation of consolidated financial statements The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenue and expense, and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could be different from these estimates. Foreign currency translation JPMorgan Chase revalues assets, liabilities, revenue and expense denominated in non-U.S. currencies into U.S. dollars using applicable exchange rates. Gains and losses relating to translating functional currency financial statements for U.S. reporting are included in the Consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Gains and losses relating to nonfunctional currency transactions, including non-U.S. operations where the functional currency is the U.S. dollar, are reported in the Consolidated statements of income. Offsetting assets and liabilities U.S. GAAP permits entities to present derivative receivables and derivative payables with the same counterparty and the related cash collateral receivables and payables on a net basis on the Consolidated balance sheets when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. U.S. GAAP also permits securities sold and purchased under repurchase agreements and securities borrowed or loaned under securities loan agreements to be presented net when specified conditions are met, including the existence of a legally enforceable master netting agreement. The Firm has elected to net such balances where it has determined that the specified conditions are met. The Firm uses master netting agreements to mitigate counterparty credit risk in certain transactions, including derivative contracts, resale, repurchase, securities borrowed and securities loaned agreements. A master netting agreement is a single agreement with a counterparty that permits multiple transactions governed by that agreement to be terminated or accelerated and settled through a single payment in a single currency in the event of a default (e.g., bankruptcy, failure to make a required payment or securities transfer or deliver collateral or margin when due). Upon the exercise of derivatives termination rights by the non-defaulting party (i) all transactions are terminated, (ii) all transactions are valued and the positive values of “in the money” transactions are netted against the negative values of “out of the money” transactions and (iii) the only remaining payment obligation is of one of the parties to pay the netted termination amount. Upon exercise of default rights under repurchase Notes to consolidated financial statements 172 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K agreements and securities loan agreements in general (i) all transactions are terminated and accelerated, (ii) all values of securities or cash held or to be delivered are calculated, and all such sums are netted against each other and (iii) the only remaining payment obligation is of one of the parties to pay the netted termination amount. Typical master netting agreements for these types of transactions also often contain a collateral/margin agreement that provides for a security interest in, or title transfer of, securities or cash collateral/margin to the party that has the right to demand margin (the “demanding party”). The collateral/margin agreement typically requires a party to transfer collateral/margin to the demanding party with a value equal to the amount of the margin deficit on a net basis across all transactions governed by the master netting agreement, less any threshold. The collateral/margin agreement grants to the demanding party, upon default by the counterparty, the right to set-off any amounts payable by the counterparty against any posted collateral or the cash equivalent of any posted collateral/margin. It also grants to the demanding party the right to liquidate collateral/margin and to apply the proceeds to an amount payable by the counterparty. Refer to Note 5 for further discussion of the Firm’s derivative instruments. Refer to Note 11 for further discussion of the Firm’s securities financing agreements. Statements of cash flows For JPMorgan Chase’s Consolidated statements of cash flows, cash is defined as those amounts included in cash and due from banks and deposits with banks on the Consolidated balance sheets. Accounting standards adopted January 1, 2023 Derivatives and Hedging: Fair Value Hedging – Portfolio Layer Method The adoption of this guidance expanded the ability to hedge a portfolio of fixed-rate assets to allow more types of assets to be included in the portfolio, and to allow more of the portfolio to be hedged. This guidance also clarified the types of derivatives that could be used as hedges, and the balance sheet presentation and disclosure requirements for the hedge accounting adjustments. As permitted by the guidance, the Firm elected to transfer HTM securities to AFS and designated those securities in a portfolio layer method hedge upon adoption. The adoption impact of the transfer on retained earnings was not material. Refer to Note 5 and Note 10 for additional information. Financial Instruments – Credit Losses: Troubled Debt Restructurings (“TDRs”) The adoption of this guidance eliminated the accounting and disclosure requirements for TDRs, including the requirement to measure the allowance using a discounted cash flow (“DCF”) methodology, and allowed the option of a non-DCF portfolio-based approach for modified loans to troubled borrowers. If a DCF methodology is still applied for these modified loans, the discount rate must be the post- modification effective interest rate, instead of the pre- modification effective interest rate. The Firm elected to apply its non-DCF, portfolio-based allowance approach for modified loans to troubled borrowers for all portfolios except collateral-dependent loans and nonaccrual risk-rated loans which the Firm elected to continue applying a DCF methodology. Refer to Note 13 for a description of the portfolio-based allowance approach and the asset-specific allowance approach. This guidance was adopted on January 1, 2023 under the modified retrospective method which resulted in a net decrease to the allowance for credit losses of $587 million and an increase to retained earnings of $446 million, after- tax, predominantly driven by residential real estate and credit card. The adoption of this guidance eliminated the disclosure requirements for TDRs including the requirement to assess whether a modification is reasonably expected or involves a concession. The new guidance requires disclosure for loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty consisting of principal forgiveness, interest rate reduction, other-than-insignificant payment delay, term extension or a combination of these modifications. The Firm has defined these types of modifications as financial difficulty modifications (\"FDMs\"). As a result of the elimination of the requirement to assess whether a modification is reasonably expected or involves a concession, the population of loans considered FDMs differs from those previously considered TDRs. This guidance also requires disclosure of current period gross charge-offs by vintage origination year. Refer to Note 12 for further information.

These assets and liabilities are predominantly carried at fair value on a recurring basis (i.e., assets and liabilities that are measured and reported at fair value on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets). Certain assets, liabilities and unfunded lending-related commitments are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis; that is, they are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments only in certain circumstances (for example, when there is evidence of impairment). Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value is based on quoted market prices or inputs, where available. If prices or quotes are not available, fair value is based on valuation models and other valuation techniques that consider relevant transaction characteristics (such as maturity) and use, as inputs, observable or unobservable market parameters, including yield curves, interest rates, volatilities, prices (such as commodity, equity or debt prices), correlations, foreign exchange rates and credit curves. Fair value may also incorporate valuation adjustments. The level of precision in estimating unobservable market inputs or other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss recorded for a particular position. Furthermore, while the Firm believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with those of other market participants, the methods and assumptions used reflect management judgment and may vary across the Firm’s businesses and portfolios. The Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in the determination of fair value. The use of different methodologies or assumptions by other market participants compared with those used by the Firm could result in the Firm deriving a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. Valuation process Risk-taking functions are responsible for providing fair value estimates for assets and liabilities carried on the Consolidated balance sheets at fair value. The Firm’s Valuation Control Group (“VCG”), which is part of the Firm’s Finance function and independent of the risk-taking functions, is responsible for verifying these estimates and determining any fair value adjustments that may be required to ensure that the Firm’s positions are recorded at fair value. In addition, the Firm’s Valuation Governance Forum (“VGF”), which is composed of senior finance and risk executives, is responsible for overseeing the management of risks arising from valuation activities conducted across the Firm. The Firmwide VGF is chaired by the Firmwide head of the VCG (under the direction of the Firm’s Controller), and includes sub-forums covering the CIB, CCB, CB, AWM and certain corporate functions including Treasury and CIO. Price verification process The VCG verifies fair value estimates provided by the risk- taking functions by leveraging independently derived prices, valuation inputs and other market data, where available. Where independent prices or inputs are not available, the VCG performs additional review to ensure the reasonableness of the estimates. The additional review may include evaluating the limited market activity including client unwinds, benchmarking valuation inputs to those used for similar instruments, decomposing the valuation of structured instruments into individual components, comparing expected to actual cash flows, reviewing profit and loss trends, and reviewing trends in collateral valuation. There are also additional levels of management review for more significant or complex positions. The VCG determines any valuation adjustments that may be required to the estimates provided by the risk-taking functions. No adjustments to quoted prices are applied for instruments classified within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy (refer to the discussion below for further information on the fair value hierarchy). For other positions, judgment is required to assess the need for valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect liquidity considerations, unobservable parameters, and, for certain portfolios that meet specified criteria, the size of the net open risk position. The determination of such adjustments follows a consistent framework across the Firm: • Liquidity valuation adjustments are considered where an observable external price or valuation parameter exists but is of lower reliability, potentially due to lower market activity. Liquidity valuation adjustments are made based on current market conditions. Factors that may be considered in determining the liquidity adjustment include analysis of: (1) the estimated bid- offer spread for the instrument being traded; (2) alternative pricing points for similar instruments in active markets; and (3) the range of reasonable values that the price or parameter could take. • The Firm manages certain portfolios of financial instruments on the basis of net open risk exposure and, as permitted by U.S. GAAP, has elected to estimate the fair value of such portfolios on the basis of a transfer of the entire net open risk position in an orderly transaction. Where this is the case, valuation adjustments may be necessary to reflect the cost of exiting a larger-than-normal market-size net open risk position. Where applied, such adjustments are based on factors that a relevant market participant would consider in the transfer of the net open risk position, including the size of the adverse market move that is likely to occur during the period required to sufficiently reduce the net open risk position. • Uncertainty adjustments related to unobservable parameters may be made when positions are valued using prices or input parameters to valuation models that are unobservable due to a lack of market activity or JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K 175 because they cannot be implied from observable market data. Such prices or parameters must be estimated and are, therefore, subject to management judgment. Adjustments are made to reflect the uncertainty inherent in the resulting valuation estimate. • Where appropriate, the Firm also applies adjustments to its estimates of fair value in order to appropriately reflect counterparty credit quality (CVA), the Firm’s own creditworthiness (DVA) and the impact of funding (FVA), using a consistent framework across the Firm. Refer to Credit and funding adjustments on page 192 of this Note for more information on such adjustments. Valuation model review and approval If prices or quotes are not available for an instrument or a similar instrument, fair value is generally determined using valuation models that consider relevant transaction terms such as maturity and use as inputs market-based or independently sourced parameters. Where this is the case the price verification process described above is applied to the inputs in those models. Under the Firm’s Estimations and Model Risk Management Policy, MRGR reviews and approves new models, as well as material changes to existing models, prior to implementation in the operating environment. In certain circumstances exceptions may be granted to the Firm’s policy to allow a model to be used prior to review or approval. MRGR may also require the user to take appropriate actions to mitigate the model risk if it is to be used in the interim. These actions will depend on the model and may include, for example, limitation of trading activity. Fair value hierarchy A three-level fair value hierarchy has been established under U.S. GAAP for disclosure of fair value measurements. The fair value hierarchy is based on the observability of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date. The three levels are defined as follows. • Level 1 – inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. • Level 2 – inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. • Level 3 – one or more inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement. A financial instrument’s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Notes to consolidated financial statements 176 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K The following table describes the valuation methodologies generally used by the Firm to measure its significant products/ instruments at fair value, including the general classification of such instruments pursuant to the fair value hierarchy. Product/instrument Valuation methodology Classifications in the fair value hierarchy Securities financing agreements Valuations are based on discounted cash flows, which consider: Predominantly level 2 • Derivative features: refer to the discussion of derivatives below for further information • Market rates for the respective maturity • Collateral characteristics Loans and lending-related commitments — wholesale Loans carried at fair value (trading loans and non-trading loans) and associated lending-related commitments Where observable market data is available, valuations are based on: Level 2 or 3 • Observed market prices (circumstances are infrequent) • Relevant broker quotes • Observed market prices for similar instruments Where observable market data is unavailable or limited, valuations are based on discounted cash flows, which consider the following: • Credit spreads derived from the cost of CDS; or benchmark credit curves developed by the Firm, by industry and credit rating • Prepayment speed • Collateral characteristics Loans — consumer Fair value is based on observable market prices for mortgage-backed securities with similar collateral and incorporates adjustments to these prices to account for differences between the securities and the value of the underlying loans, which include credit characteristics, portfolio composition, and liquidity. Predominantly level 2 Loans carried at fair value — conforming residential mortgage loans expected to be sold Investment and trading securities Quoted market prices Level 1 In the absence of quoted market prices, securities are valued based on: Level 2 or 3 • Observable market prices for similar securities • Relevant broker quotes • Discounted cash flows In addition, the following inputs to discounted cash flows are used for the following products: Mortgage- and asset-backed securities specific inputs: • Collateral characteristics • Deal-specific payment and loss allocations • Current market assumptions related to yield, prepayment speed, conditional default rates and loss severity Collateralized loan obligations (“CLOs”) specific inputs: • Collateral characteristics • Deal-specific payment and loss allocations • Expected prepayment speed, conditional default rates, loss severity • Credit spreads • Credit rating data Physical commodities Valued using observable market prices or data. Level 1 or 2 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K 177 Product/instrument Valuation methodology Classifications in the fair value hierarchy Derivatives Actively traded derivatives, e.g., exchange-traded derivatives, that are valued using quoted prices. Level 1 Derivatives that are valued using models such as the Black-Scholes option pricing model, simulation models, or a combination of models that may use observable or unobservable valuation inputs as well as considering the contractual terms. The key valuation inputs used will depend on the type of derivative and the nature of the underlying instruments and may include equity prices, commodity prices, foreign exchange rates, volatilities, correlations, CDS spreads, recovery rates and prepayment speed. Level 2 or 3 In addition, specific inputs used for derivatives that are valued based on models with significant unobservable inputs are as follows: Interest rate and FX exotic derivatives specific inputs include: • Interest rate curve • Interest rate volatility • Interest rate spread volatility • Bermudan switch value • Interest rate correlation • Interest rate-FX correlation • Foreign exchange correlation Credit derivatives specific inputs include: • Credit correlation between the underlying debt instruments Equity derivatives specific inputs include: • Forward equity price • Equity volatility • Equity correlation • Equity-FX correlation • Equity-IR correlation Commodity derivatives specific inputs include: • Forward commodity price • Commodity volatility • Commodity correlation Additionally, adjustments are made to reflect counterparty credit quality (CVA) and the impact of funding (FVA). Refer to page 192 of this Note. Mortgage servicing rights Refer to Mortgage servicing rights in Note 15. Level 3 Private equity direct investments Fair value is estimated using all available information; the range of potential inputs include: Level 2 or 3 • Transaction prices • Trading multiples of comparable public companies • Operating performance of the underlying portfolio company • Adjustments as required, since comparable public companies are not identical to the company being valued, and for company-specific issues including lack of liquidity • Additional available inputs relevant to the investment Fund investments (e.g., mutual/collective investment funds, private equity funds, hedge funds, and real estate funds) Net asset value • NAV is supported by the ability to redeem and purchase at the NAV level Level 1 • Adjustments to the NAV as required, for restrictions on redemption (e.g., lock-up periods or withdrawal limitations) or where observable activity is limited Level 2 or 3(a) Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs Valued using observable market information, where available. Level 2 or 3 In the absence of observable market information, valuations are based on the fair value of the underlying assets held by the VIE. (a) Excludes certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient. Notes to consolidated financial statements 178 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K Product/instrument Valuation methodology Classification in the fair value hierarchy Structured notes (included in deposits, short-term borrowings and long-term debt) Valuations are based on discounted cash flow analyses that consider the embedded derivative and the terms and payment structure of the note. The embedded derivative features are considered using models such as the Black-Scholes option pricing model, simulation models, or a combination of models that may use observable or unobservable valuation inputs, depending on the embedded derivative. The specific inputs used vary according to the nature of the embedded derivative features, as described in the discussion above regarding derivatives valuation. Adjustments are then made to this base valuation to reflect the Firm’s own credit risk (DVA). Refer to page 192 of this Note.

billion and $73.8 billion, respectively, which were mortgage-related. (b) Physical commodities inventories are generally accounted for at the lower of cost or net realizable value. “Net realizable value” is a term defined in U.S. GAAP as not exceeding fair value less costs to sell (“transaction costs”). Transaction costs for the Firm’s physical commodities inventories are either not applicable or immaterial to the value of the inventory. Therefore, net realizable value approximates fair value for the Firm’s physical commodities inventories. When fair value hedging has been applied (or when net realizable value is below cost), the carrying value of physical commodities approximates fair value, because under fair value hedge accounting, the cost basis is adjusted for changes in fair value. Refer to Note 5 for a further discussion of the Firm’s hedge accounting relationships. To provide consistent fair value disclosure information, all physical commodities inventories have been included in each period presented. (c) Balances reflect the reduction of securities owned (long positions) by the amount of identical securities sold but not yet purchased (short positions). JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K 181 Fair value hierarchyFair value hierarchy (d) Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient are not required to be classified in the fair value hierarchy. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the fair values of these investments, which include certain hedge funds, private equity funds, real estate and other funds, were $1.0 billion and $950 million, respectively. Included in these balances at December 31, 2023 and 2022, were trading assets of $42 million and $43 million, respectively, and other assets of $984 million and $907 million, respectively. (e) At December 31, 2023 and 2022, included $10.2 billion and $9.7 billion, respectively, of residential first-lien mortgages, and $6.0 billion and $6.8 billion, respectively, of commercial first-lien mortgages. Residential mortgage loans include conforming mortgage loans originated with the intent to sell to U.S. GSEs and government agencies of $2.9 billion and $2.4 billion, respectively. (f) As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative receivables and derivative payables and the related cash collateral received and paid when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. The level 3 balances would be reduced if netting were applied, including the netting benefit associated with cash collateral. Notes to consolidated financial statements 182 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K Level 3 valuations The Firm has established well-structured processes for determining fair value, including for instruments where fair value is estimated using significant unobservable inputs (level 3). Refer to pages 175–179 of this Note for further information on the Firm’s valuation process and a detailed discussion of the determination of fair value for individual financial instruments. Estimating fair value requires the application of judgment. The type and level of judgment required is largely dependent on the amount of observable market information available to the Firm. For instruments valued using internally developed valuation models and other valuation techniques that use significant unobservable inputs and are therefore classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, judgments used to estimate fair value are more significant than those required when estimating the fair value of instruments classified within levels 1 and 2. In arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument within level 3, management must first determine the appropriate valuation model or other valuation technique to use. Second, due to the lack of observability of significant inputs, management must assess relevant empirical data in deriving valuation inputs including transaction details, yield curves, interest rates, prepayment speed, default rates, volatilities, correlations, prices (such as commodity, equity or debt prices), valuations of comparable instruments, foreign exchange rates and credit curves. The following table presents the Firm’s primary level 3 financial instruments, the valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of those financial instruments, the significant unobservable inputs, the range of values for those inputs and the weighted or arithmetic averages of such inputs. While the determination to classify an instrument within level 3 is based on the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement, level 3 financial instruments typically include observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources) in addition to the unobservable components. The level 1 and/or level 2 inputs are not included in the table. In addition, the Firm manages the risk of the observable components of level 3 financial instruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified within levels 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The range of values presented in the table is representative of the highest and lowest level input used to value the significant groups of instruments within a product/instrument classification. Where provided, the weighted averages of the input values presented in the table are calculated based on the fair value of the instruments that the input is being used to value. In the Firm’s view, the input range, weighted and arithmetic average values do not reflect the degree of input uncertainty or an assessment of the reasonableness of the Firm’s estimates and assumptions. Rather, they reflect the characteristics of the various instruments held by the Firm and the relative distribution of instruments within the range of characteristics. For example, two option contracts may have similar levels of market risk exposure and valuation uncertainty, but may have significantly different implied volatility levels because the option contracts have different underlyings, tenors, or strike prices. The input range and weighted and arithmetic average values will therefore vary from period-to-period and parameter-to-parameter based on the characteristics of the instruments held by the Firm at each balance sheet date.

The impact of changes in inputs may not be independent, as a change in one unobservable input may give rise to a change in another unobservable input. Where relationships do exist between two unobservable inputs, those relationships are discussed below. Relationships may also exist between observable and unobservable inputs (for example, as observable interest rates rise, unobservable prepayment rates decline); such relationships have not been included in the discussion below. In addition, for each of the individual relationships described below, the inverse relationship would also generally apply. The following discussion also provides a description of attributes of the underlying instruments and external market factors that affect the range of inputs used in the valuation of the Firm’s positions. Yield – The yield of an asset is the interest rate used to discount future cash flows in a discounted cash flow calculation. An increase in the yield, in isolation, would result in a decrease in a fair value measurement. Credit spread – The credit spread is the amount of additional annualized return over the market interest rate that a market participant would demand for taking exposure to the credit risk of an instrument. The credit spread for an instrument forms part of the discount rate used in a discounted cash flow calculation. Generally, an increase in the credit spread would result in a decrease in a fair value measurement. The yield and the credit spread of a particular mortgage- backed security primarily reflect the risk inherent in the instrument. The yield is also impacted by the absolute level of the coupon paid by the instrument (which may not correspond directly to the level of inherent risk). Therefore, the range of yield and credit spreads reflects the range of risk inherent in various instruments owned by the Firm. The risk inherent in mortgage-backed securities is driven by the subordination of the security being valued and the characteristics of the underlying mortgages within the collateralized pool, including borrower FICO scores, LTV ratios for residential mortgages and the nature of the property and/or any tenants for commercial mortgages. For corporate debt securities, obligations of U.S. states and municipalities and other similar instruments, credit spreads reflect the credit quality of the obligor and the tenor of the obligation. Prepayment speed – The prepayment speed is a measure of the voluntary unscheduled principal repayments of a prepayable obligation in a collateralized pool. Prepayment speeds generally decline as borrower delinquencies rise. An increase in prepayment speeds, in isolation, would result in a decrease in a fair value measurement of assets valued at a premium to par and an increase in a fair value measurement of assets valued at a discount to par. Prepayment speeds may vary from collateral pool to collateral pool, and are driven by the type and location of the underlying borrower, and the remaining tenor of the obligation as well as the level and type (e.g., fixed or floating) of interest rate being paid by the borrower. Typically collateral pools with higher borrower credit quality have a higher prepayment rate than those with lower borrower credit quality, all other factors being equal. Conditional default rate – The conditional default rate is a measure of the reduction in the outstanding collateral balance underlying a collateralized obligation as a result of defaults. While there is typically no direct relationship between conditional default rates and prepayment speeds, collateralized obligations for which the underlying collateral has high prepayment speeds will tend to have lower conditional default rates. An increase in conditional default rates would generally be accompanied by an increase in loss severity and an increase in credit spreads. An increase in the conditional default rate, in isolation, would result in a decrease in a fair value measurement. Conditional default rates reflect the quality of the collateral underlying a securitization and the structure of the securitization itself. Based on the types of securities owned in the Firm’s market- making portfolios, conditional default rates are most typically at the lower end of the range presented. Loss severity – The loss severity (the inverse concept is the recovery rate) is the expected amount of future realized losses resulting from the ultimate liquidation of a particular loan, expressed as the net amount of loss relative to the outstanding loan balance. An increase in loss severity is generally accompanied by an increase in conditional default rates. An increase in the loss severity, in isolation, would result in a decrease in a fair value measurement. The loss severity applied in valuing a mortgage-backed security depends on factors relating to the underlying mortgages, including the LTV ratio, the nature of the lender’s lien on the property and other instrument-specific factors. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K 185 Correlation – Correlation is a measure of the relationship between the movements of two variables. Correlation is a pricing input for a derivative product where the payoff is driven by one or more underlying risks. Correlation inputs are related to the type of derivative (e.g., interest rate, credit, equity, foreign exchange and commodity) due to the nature of the underlying risks. When parameters are positively correlated, an increase in one parameter will result in an increase in the other parameter. When parameters are negatively correlated, an increase in one parameter will result in a decrease in the other parameter. An increase in correlation can result in an increase or a decrease in a fair value measurement. Given a short correlation position, an increase in correlation, in isolation, would generally result in a decrease in a fair value measurement. The level of correlation used in the valuation of derivatives with multiple underlying risks depends on a number of factors including the nature of those risks. For example, the correlation between two credit risk exposures would be different than that between two interest rate risk exposures. Similarly, the tenor of the transaction may also impact the correlation input, as the relationship between the underlying risks may be different over different time periods. Furthermore, correlation levels are very much dependent on market conditions and could have a relatively wide range of levels within or across asset classes over time, particularly in volatile market conditions. Volatility – Volatility is a measure of the variability in possible returns for an instrument, parameter or market index given how much the particular instrument, parameter or index changes in value over time. Volatility is a pricing input for options, including equity options, commodity options, and interest rate options. Generally, the higher the volatility of the underlying, the riskier the instrument. Given a long position in an option, an increase in volatility, in isolation, would generally result in an increase in a fair value measurement. The level of volatility used in the valuation of a particular option-based derivative depends on a number of factors, including the nature of the risk underlying the option (e.g., the volatility of a particular equity security may be significantly different from that of a particular commodity index), the tenor of the derivative as well as the strike price of the option. Bermudan switch value – The switch value is the difference between the overall value of a Bermudan swaption, which can be exercised at multiple points in time, and its most expensive European swaption and reflects the additional value that the multiple exercise dates provide the holder. Switch values are dependent on market conditions and can vary greatly depending on a number of factors, such as the tenor of the underlying swap as well as the strike price of the option. An increase in switch value, in isolation, would generally result in an increase in a fair value measurement. Interest rate curve – The interest rate curve represents the relationship of interest rates over differing tenors. The interest rate curve is used to set interest rate and foreign exchange derivative cash flows and is also a pricing input used in the discounting of any derivative cash flow. Forward price – The forward price is the price at which the buyer agrees to purchase the asset underlying a forward contract on the predetermined future delivery date, and is such that the value of the contract is zero at inception. The forward price is used as an input in the valuation of certain derivatives and depends on a number of factors including interest rates, the current price of the underlying asset, and the expected income to be received and costs to be incurred by the seller as a result of holding that asset until the delivery date. An increase in the forward can result in an increase or a decrease in a fair value measurement. Changes in level 3 recurring fair value measurements The following tables include a rollforward of the Consolidated balance sheets amounts (including changes in fair value) for financial instruments classified by the Firm within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021. When a determination is made to classify a financial instrument within level 3, the determination is based on the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement. However, level 3 financial instruments typically include, in addition to the unobservable or level 3 components, observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources); accordingly, the gains and losses in the table below include changes in fair value due in part to observable factors that are part of the valuation methodology. The Firm risk- manages the observable components of level 3 financial instruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified within level 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy; as these level 1 and level 2 risk management instruments are not included below, the gains or losses in the following tables do not reflect the effect of the Firm’s risk management activities related to such level 3 instruments.

All transfers are based on changes in the observability and/or significance of the valuation inputs and are assumed to occur at the beginning of the quarterly reporting period in which they occur. Gains and losses The following describes significant components of total realized/unrealized gains/(losses) for instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021. These amounts exclude any effects of the Firm’s risk management activities where the financial instruments are classified as level 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Refer to Changes in level 3 recurring fair value measurements rollforward tables on pages 186–190 for further information on these instruments. 2023 • $1.8 billion of net gains on assets, largely driven by gains in net interest rate derivative receivables due to market movements and gains in MSRs reflecting lower prepayment speeds on higher rates. • $3.3 billion of net losses on liabilities, predominantly driven by losses in long-term debt due to market movements. 2022 • $7.7 billion of net gains on assets, predominantly driven by gains in net equity derivative receivables due to market movements and gains in MSRs reflecting lower prepayment speeds on higher rates. • $4.6 billion of net gains on liabilities, predominantly driven by a decline in the fair value of long-term debt due to market movements. 2021 • $495 million of net gains on assets, driven by gains in net interest rate derivative receivables due to market movements, partially offset by losses in net equity derivative receivables and net commodity derivative receivables due to market movements. • $1.1 billion of net gains on liabilities, driven by gains in short-term borrowings due to market movements. Refer to Note 15 for information on MSRs. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K 191 Credit and funding adjustments – derivatives Derivatives are generally valued using models that use as their basis observable market parameters. These market parameters generally do not consider factors such as counterparty nonperformance risk, the Firm’s own credit quality, and funding costs. Therefore, it is generally necessary to make adjustments to the base estimate of fair value to reflect these factors. CVA represents the adjustment, relative to the relevant benchmark interest rate, necessary to reflect counterparty nonperformance risk. The Firm estimates CVA using a scenario analysis to estimate the expected positive credit exposure across all of the Firm’s existing positions with each counterparty, and then estimates losses based on the probability of default and estimated recovery rate as a result of a counterparty credit event considering contractual factors designed to mitigate the Firm’s credit exposure, such as collateral and legal rights of offset. The key inputs to this methodology are (i) the probability of a default event occurring for each counterparty, as derived from observed or estimated CDS spreads; and (ii) estimated recovery rates implied by CDS spreads, adjusted to consider the differences in recovery rates as a derivative creditor relative to those reflected in CDS spreads, which generally reflect senior unsecured creditor risk. FVA represents the adjustment to reflect the impact of funding and is recognized where there is evidence that a market participant in the principal market would incorporate it in a transfer of the instrument. The Firm’s FVA framework, applied to uncollateralized (including partially collateralized) over-the-counter (“OTC”) derivatives incorporates key inputs such as: (i) the expected funding requirements arising from the Firm’s positions with each counterparty and collateral arrangements; and (ii) the estimated market funding cost in the principal market which, for derivative liabilities, considers the Firm’s credit risk (DVA). For collateralized derivatives, the fair value is estimated by discounting expected future cash flows at the relevant overnight indexed swap rate given the underlying collateral agreement with the counterparty, and therefore a separate FVA is not necessary. The following table provides the impact of credit and funding adjustments on principal transactions revenue in the respective periods, excluding the effect of any associated hedging activities. The FVA presented below includes the impact of the Firm’s own credit quality on the inception value of liabilities as well as the impact of changes in the Firm’s own credit quality over time. Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2023 2022 2021 Credit and funding adjustments: Derivatives CVA $ 221 $ 22 $ 362 Derivatives FVA 114 42 47 Valuation adjustments on fair value option elected liabilities The valuation of the Firm’s liabilities for which the fair value option has been elected requires consideration of the Firm’s own credit risk. DVA on fair value option elected liabilities reflects changes (subsequent to the issuance of the liability) in the Firm’s probability of default and LGD, which are estimated based on changes in the Firm’s credit spread observed in the bond market. Realized (gains)/losses due to DVA for fair value option elected liabilities are reported in principal transactions revenue. Unrealized (gains)/losses are reported in OCI. Refer to page 190 in this Note and Note 24 for further information. Notes to consolidated financial statements 192 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis The following tables present the assets and liabilities held as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, for which nonrecurring fair value adjustments were recorded during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, by major product category and fair value hierarchy.

Of the $1.3 billion in level 3 assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as of December 31, 2023, $412 million related to equity securities adjusted based on the measurement alternative. These equity securities are classified as level 3 due to the infrequency of the observable prices and/or the restrictions on the shares. Nonrecurring fair value changes The following table presents the total change in value of assets and liabilities for which fair value adjustments have been recognized for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, related to assets and liabilities held at those dates.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K 193 Fair value hierarchy Fair value hierarchy Fair value hierarchy Fair value hierarchy Equity securities without readily determinable fair values The Firm measures certain equity securities without readily determinable fair values at cost less impairment (if any), plus or minus observable price changes from an identical or similar investment of the same issuer (i.e., measurement alternative), with such changes recognized in other income. In its determination of the new carrying values upon observable price changes, the Firm may adjust the prices if deemed necessary to arrive at the Firm’s estimated fair values. Such adjustments may include adjustments to reflect the different rights and obligations of similar securities, and other adjustments that are consistent with the Firm’s valuation techniques for private equity direct investments. The following table presents the carrying value of equity securities without readily determinable fair values held as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, that are measured under the measurement alternative and the related adjustments recorded during the periods presented for those securities with observable price changes. These securities are included in the nonrecurring fair value tables when applicable price changes are observable. As of or for the year ended December 31, (in millions) 2023 2022 Other assets Carrying value(a) $ 4,457 $ 4,096 Upward carrying value changes(b) 93 488 Downward carrying value changes/impairment(c) (325) (826) (a) The period-end carrying values reflect cumulative purchases and sales in addition to upward and downward carrying value changes. (b) The cumulative upward carrying value changes between January 1, 2018 and December 31, 2023 were $1.2 billion. (c) The cumulative downward carrying value changes/impairment between January 1, 2018 and December 31, 2023 were $(1.2) billion. Included in other assets above is the Firm’s interest in approximately 37 million Visa Class B common shares (“Visa B shares”). These shares are subject to certain transfer restrictions and are convertible into Visa Class A common shares (“Visa A shares”) at a specified conversion rate upon final resolution of certain litigation matters involving Visa. The conversion rate of Visa B shares to Visa A shares was 1.5875 at December 31, 2023 and may be adjusted by Visa depending on developments related to the litigation matters. The outcome of those litigation matters, and the effect that the resolution of those matters may have on the conversion rate, is unknown. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2023, there is significant uncertainty regarding when the transfer restrictions on Visa B shares may be terminated and what the final conversion rate for the Visa B shares will be. As a result of these considerations, as well as differences in voting rights, Visa B shares are not considered to be similar to Visa A shares, and they continue to be held at their nominal carrying value. In connection with prior sales of Visa B shares, the Firm has entered into derivative instruments with the purchasers of the shares under which the Firm retains the risk associated with changes in the conversion rate. Under the terms of the derivative instruments, the Firm will (a) make or receive payments based on subsequent changes in the conversion rate and (b) make periodic interest payments to the purchasers of the Visa B shares. The payments under the derivative instruments will continue as long as the Visa B shares remain subject to transfer restrictions. The derivative instruments are accounted for at fair value using a discounted cash flow methodology based upon the Firm’s estimate of the timing and magnitude of final resolution of the litigation matters. The derivative instruments are recorded in trading liabilities, and changes in fair value are recognized in other income. As of December 31, 2023, the Firm held derivative instruments associated with 23 million Visa B shares that the Firm had previously sold, which are all subject to similar terms and conditions. On January 24, 2024, Visa filed a Current Report on Form 8-K with the SEC announcing that Visa’s stockholders approved amendments to its Certificate of Incorporation that redenominate the Visa B shares to Visa Class B-1 common shares (“Visa B-1 shares”) and authorize Visa to conduct one or more exchange offers (\"the Program\") which, if conducted, would have the effect of releasing transfer restrictions on a portion of Visa's B-1 shares through an exchange for Visa Class C common shares (“Visa C shares”). The Program would entitle the Firm to exchange its Visa B-1 shares, for Visa Class B-2 common shares (”Visa B-2 shares”) and Visa C shares, through an initial exchange offer if and when conducted by Visa. The Visa B-2 shares would continue to be subject to the transfer restrictions associated with the Visa B shares. The Firm is then entitled to sell the Visa C shares received after a brief lock-up period expires, and Visa is also authorized to extend offers for potential future exchanges, each enabling the release of additional Visa B shares if certain conditions are met. The timing and likelihood of any initial or future exchange offer is dependent upon actions taken by Visa and other factors that may be outside of the Firm’s control. Notes to consolidated financial statements 194 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K Additional disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments that are not carried on the Consolidated balance sheets at fair value U.S. GAAP requires disclosure of the estimated fair value of certain financial instruments, which are included in the following table. However, this table does not include other items, such as nonfinancial assets, intangible assets, certain financial instruments, and customer relationships. In the opinion of management, these ite ms, in the aggregate, add significant value to JPMorgan Chase. Financial instruments for which carrying value approximates fair value Certain financial instruments that are not carried at fair value on the Consolidated balance sheets are carried at amounts that approximate fair value, due to their short- term nature and generally negligible credit risk. These instruments include cash and due from banks, deposits with banks, federal funds sold, securities purchased under resale agreements and securities borrowed, short-term receivables and accrued interest receivable, short-term borrowings, federal funds purchased, securities loaned and sold under repurchase agreements, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities. In addition, U.S. GAAP requires that the fair value of deposit liabilities with no stated maturity (i.e., demand, savings and certain money market deposits) be equal to their carrying value; recognition of the inherent funding value of these instruments is not permitted. The following table presents, by fair value hierarchy classification, the carrying values and estimated fair values at December 31, 2023 and 2022, of financial assets and liabilities, excluding financial instruments that are carried at fair value on a recurring basis, and their classification within the fair value hierarchy.

For certain loans, the fair value is measured based on the value of the underlying collateral. Carrying value of the loan takes into account the loan’s allowance for loan losses, which represents the loan’s expected credit losses over its remaining expected life. The difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value of a loan is generally attributable to changes in market interest rates, including credit spreads, market liquidity premiums and other factors that affect the fair value of a loan but do not affect its carrying value. (b) Includes FHLB advances in level 2 of Long-term debt and Short-term borrowings and the Purchase Money Note in level 3 of Long-term debt associated with First Republic.

The Firm has elected to measure certain instruments at fair value for several reasons including to mitigate income statement volatility caused by the differences between the measurement basis of elected instruments (e.g., certain instruments that otherwise would be accounted for on an accrual basis) and the associated risk management arrangements that are accounted for on a fair value basis, as well as to better reflect those instruments that are managed on a fair value basis. The Firm’s election of fair value includes the following instruments: • Loans purchased or originated as part of securitization warehousing activity, subject to bifurcation accounting, or managed on a fair value basis, including lending- related commitments • Certain securities financing agreements • Owned beneficial interests in securitized financial assets that contain embedded credit derivatives, which would otherwise be required to be separately accounted for as a derivative instrument • Structured notes and other hybrid instruments, which are predominantly financial instruments that contain embedded derivatives, that are issued or transacted as part of client-driven activities • Certain long-term beneficial interests issued by CIB’s consolidated securitization trusts where the underlying assets are carried at fair value JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K 197 Changes in fair value under the fair value option election The following table presents the changes in fair value included in the Consolidated statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, for items for which the fair value option was elected. The profit and loss information presented below only includes the financial instruments that were elected to be measured at fair value; related risk management instruments, which are required to be measured at fair value, are not included in the table. 2023 2022 2021 December 31, (in millions) Principal transactions All other income Total changes in fair value recorded(e) Principal transactions All other income Total changes in fair value recorded(e) Principal transactions All other income Total changes in fair value recorded(e) Federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements $ 300 $ — $ 300 $ (384) $ — $ (384) $ (112) $ — $ (112) Securities borrowed 164 — 164 (499) — (499) (200) — (200) Trading assets: Debt and equity instruments, excluding loans 3,656 — 3,656 (1,703) — (1,703) (2,171) (1) (c) (2,172) Loans reported as trading assets: Changes in instrument- specific credit risk 248 — 248 (136) — (136) 353 — 353 Other changes in fair value 3 5 (c) 8 (59) — (59) (8) — (8) Loans: Changes in instrument- specific credit risk 322 (4) (c) 318 (242) 21 (c) (221) 589 (7) (c) 582 Other changes in fair value 427 216 (c) 643 (1,421) (794) (c) (2,215) (139) 2,056 (c) 1,917 Other assets 282 (4) (d) 278 39 (6) (d) 33 12 (26) (d) (14) Deposits(a) (2,582) — (2,582) 901 — 901 (183) — (183) Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements (121) — (121) 181 — 181 69 — 69 Short-term borrowings(a) (567) — (567) 473 — 473 (366) — (366) Trading liabilities (24) — (24) 43 — 43 7 — 7 Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs — — — (1) — (1) — — — Other liabilities (16) — (16) (11) — (11) (17) — (17) Long-term debt(a)(b) (5,875) (78) (c)(d) (5,953) 8,990 98 (c)(d) 9,088 (980) 4 (c)(d) (976) (a) Unrealized gains/(losses) due to instrument-specific credit risk (DVA) for liabilities for which the fair value option has been elected are recorded in OCI, while realized gains/(losses) are recorded in principal transactions revenue.

(e) Changes in fair value exclude contractual interest, which is included in interest income and interest expense for all instruments other than certain hybrid financial instruments in CIB. Refer to Note 7 for further information regarding interest income and interest expense. Determination of instrument-specific credit risk for items for which the fair value option was elected The following describes how the gains and losses that are attributable to changes in instrument-specific credit risk, were determined. • Loans and lending-related commitments: For floating- rate instruments, all changes in value are attributed to instrument-specific credit risk. For fixed-rate instruments, an allocation of the changes in value for the period is made between those changes in value that are interest rate-related and changes in value that are credit-related. Allocations are generally based on an analysis of borrower-specific credit spread and recovery information, where available, or benchmarking to similar entities or industries. • Long-term debt: Changes in value attributable to instrument-specific credit risk were derived principally from observable changes in the Firm’s credit spread as observed in the bond market. • Securities financing agreements: Generally, for these types of agreements, there is a requirement that collateral be maintained with a market value equal to or in excess of the principal amount loaned; as a result, there would be no adjustment or an immaterial adjustment for instrument-specific credit risk related to these agreements.

(b) There were no performing loans that were ninety days or more past due as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. (c) Remaining contractual principal is not applicable to nonprincipal-protected structured notes and long-term beneficial interests. Unlike principal-protected structured notes and long-term beneficial interests, for which the Firm is obligated to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, nonprincipal- protected structured notes and long-term beneficial interests do not obligate the Firm to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, but for structured notes to return an amount based on the performance of an underlying variable or derivative feature embedded in the note. However, investors are exposed to the credit risk of the Firm as issuer for both nonprincipal-protected and principal-protected notes. (d) Where the Firm issues principal-protected zero-coupon or discount notes, the balance reflects the contractual principal payment at maturity or, if applicable, the contractual principal payment at the Firm’s next call date. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the contractual amount of lending-related commitments for which the fair value option was elected was $9.7 billion and $7.6 billion, respectively, with a corresponding fair value of $97 million and $24 million, respectively.

JPMorgan Chase regularly monitors various segments of its credit portfolios to assess potential credit risk concentrations and to obtain additional collateral when deemed necessary and permitted under the Firm’s agreements. Senior management is significantly involved in the credit approval and review process, and risk levels are adjusted as needed to reflect the Firm’s risk appetite. In the Firm’s consumer portfolio, concentrations are managed primarily by product and by U.S. geographic region, with a key focus on trends and concentrations at the portfolio level, where potential credit risk concentrations can be remedied through changes in underwriting policies and portfolio guidelines. Refer to Note 12 for additional information on the geographic composition of the Firm’s consumer loan portfolios. In the wholesale portfolio, credit risk concentrations are evaluated primarily by industry and monitored regularly on both an aggregate portfolio level and on an individual client or counterparty basis. The Firm’s wholesale exposure is managed through loan syndications and participations, loan sales, securitizations, credit derivatives, master netting agreements, collateral and other risk-reduction techniques. Refer to Note 12 for additional information on loans. The Firm does not believe that its exposure to any particular loan product or industry segment results in a significant concentration of credit risk. Terms of loan products and collateral coverage are included in the Firm’s assessment when extending credit and establishing its allowance for credit losses. Refer to Note 13 for additional information on the allowance for credit losses.

Notes to consolidated financial statements 202 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K On-balance sheet On-balance sheet 2023 20222023 20222023 2022 Note 5 – Derivative instruments Derivative contracts derive their value from underlying asset prices, indices, reference rates, other inputs or a combination of these factors and may expose counterparties to risks and rewards of an underlying asset or liability without having to initially invest in, own or exchange the asset or liability. JPMorgan Chase makes markets in derivatives for clients and also uses derivatives to hedge or manage its own risk exposures. Predominantly all of the Firm’s derivatives are entered into for market- making or risk management purposes. Market-making derivatives The majority of the Firm’s derivatives are entered into for market-making purposes. Clients use derivatives to mitigate or modify interest rate, credit, foreign exchange, equity and commodity risks. The Firm actively manages the risks from its exposure to these derivatives by entering into other derivative contracts or by purchasing or selling other financial instruments that partially or fully offset the exposure from client derivatives. Risk management derivatives The Firm manages certain market and credit risk exposures using derivative instruments, including derivatives in hedge accounting relationships and other derivatives that are used to manage risks associated with specified assets and liabilities. The Firm generally uses interest rate derivatives to manage the risk associated with changes in interest rates. Fixed-rate assets and liabilities appreciate or depreciate in market value as interest rates change. Similarly, interest income and expense increase or decrease as a result of variable- rate assets and liabilities resetting to current market rates, and as a result of the repayment and subsequent origination or issuance of fixed-rate assets and liabilities at current market rates. Gains and losses on the derivative instruments related to these assets and liabilities are expected to substantially offset this variability. Foreign currency derivatives are used to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with certain foreign currency–denominated (i.e., non-U.S. dollar) assets and liabilities and forecasted transactions, as well as the Firm’s net investments in certain non-U.S. subsidiaries or branches whose functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar. As a result of fluctuations in foreign currencies, the U.S. dollar– equivalent values of the foreign currency–denominated assets and liabilities or the forecasted revenues or expenses increase or decrease. Gains or losses on the derivative instruments related to these foreign currency–denominated assets or liabilities, or forecasted transactions, are expected to substantially offset this variability. Commodities derivatives are used to manage the price risk of certain commodities inventories. Gains or losses on these derivative instruments are expected to substantially offset the depreciation or appreciation of the related inventory. Credit derivatives are used to manage the counterparty credit risk associated with loans and lending-related commitments. Credit derivatives compensate the purchaser when the entity referenced in the contract experiences a credit event, such as bankruptcy or a failure to pay an obligation when due. Credit derivatives primarily consist of CDS. Refer to the Credit derivatives section on pages 214– 216 of this Note for a further discussion of credit derivatives. Refer to the risk management derivatives gains and losses table on page 214 and the hedge accounting gains and losses tables on pages 211–213 of this Note for more information about risk management derivatives. Derivative counterparties and settlement types The Firm enters into OTC derivatives, which are negotiated and settled bilaterally with the derivative counterparty. The Firm also enters into, as principal, certain ETD such as futures and options, and OTC-cleared derivative contracts with CCPs. ETD contracts are generally standardized contracts traded on an exchange and cleared by the CCP, which is the Firm’s counterparty from the inception of the transactions. OTC-cleared derivatives are traded on a bilateral basis and then novated to the CCP for clearing. Derivative clearing services The Firm provides clearing services for clients in which the Firm acts as a clearing member at certain exchanges and clearing houses. The Firm does not reflect the clients’ derivative contracts in its Consolidated Financial Statements. Refer to Note 28 for further information on the Firm’s clearing services. Accounting for derivatives All free-standing derivatives that the Firm executes for its own account are required to be recorded on the Consolidated balance sheets at fair value. As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm nets derivative assets and liabilities, and the related cash collateral receivables and payables, when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists between the Firm and the derivative counterparty. Refer to Note 1 for further discussion of the offsetting of assets and liabilities. The accounting for changes in value of a derivative depends on whether or not the transaction has been designated and qualifies for hedge accounting. Derivatives that are not designated as hedges are reported and measured at fair value through earnings. The tabular disclosures on pages 207–214 of this Note provide additional information on the amount of, and reporting for, derivative assets, liabilities, gains and losses. Refer to Notes 2 and 3 for a further discussion of derivatives embedded in structured notes. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K 203 Derivatives designated as hedges The Firm applies hedge accounting to certain derivatives executed for risk management purposes – generally interest rate, foreign exchange and commodity derivatives. However, JPMorgan Chase does not seek to apply hedge accounting to all of the derivatives associated with the Firm’s risk management activities. For example, the Firm does not apply hedge accounting to purchased CDS used to manage the credit risk of loans and lending-related commitments, because of the difficulties in qualifying such contracts as hedges. For the same reason, the Firm does not apply hedge accounting to certain interest rate, foreign exchange, and commodity derivatives used for risk management purposes. To qualify for hedge accounting, a derivative must be highly effective at reducing the risk associated with the exposure being hedged. In addition, for a derivative to be designated as a hedge, the risk management objective and strategy must be documented. Hedge documentation must identify the derivative hedging instrument, the asset or liability or forecasted transaction and type of risk to be hedged, and how the effectiveness of the derivative is assessed prospectively and retrospectively. To assess effectiveness, the Firm uses statistical methods such as regression analysis, nonstatistical methods such as dollar-value comparisons of the change in the fair value of the derivative to the change in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item, and qualitative comparisons of critical terms and the evaluation of any changes in those terms. The extent to which a derivative has been, and is expected to continue to be, highly effective at offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item must be assessed and documented at least quarterly. If it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective at hedging the designated exposure, hedge accounting is discontinued. There are three types of hedge accounting designations: fair value hedges, cash flow hedges and net investment hedges. JPMorgan Chase uses fair value hedges primarily to hedge fixed-rate long-term debt, AFS securities and certain commodities inventories. For qualifying fair value hedges, the changes in the fair value of the derivative, and in the value of the hedged item for the risk being hedged, are recognized in earnings. Certain amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recorded in OCI and recognized in earnings over the life of the derivative. If the hedge relationship is terminated, then the adjustment to the hedged item continues to be reported as part of the basis of the hedged item and, for interest-bearing financial instruments, is amortized to earnings as a yield adjustment. Derivative amounts affecting earnings are recognized consistent with the classification of the hedged item – primarily net interest income and principal transactions revenue. Effective January 1, 2023, the Firm adopted the new portfolio layer method hedge accounting guidance which expanded the ability to hedge a portfolio of fixed-rate assets to allow more types of assets to be included in the portfolio, and to allow more of the portfolio to be hedged. The Firm employs the Portfolio Layer Method to manage the interest rate risk of portfolios of fixed-rate assets. Throughout the life of the open hedge, basis adjustments are maintained at the portfolio level and are only allocated to individual assets under certain circumstances. These include instances where the portfolio amount falls below the hedged layer amounts, or in cases of voluntary de- designation. JPMorgan Chase uses cash flow hedges primarily to hedge the exposure to variability in forecasted cash flows from floating-rate assets and liabilities and foreign currency– denominated revenue and expense. For qualifying cash flow hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in OCI and recognized in earnings as the hedged item affects earnings. Derivative amounts affecting earnings are recognized consistent with the classification of the hedged item – primarily noninterest revenue, net interest income and compensation expense. If the hedge relationship is terminated, then the change in value of the derivative recorded in AOCI is recognized in earnings when the cash flows that were hedged affect earnings. For hedge relationships that are discontinued because a forecasted transaction is expected to not occur according to the original hedge forecast, any related derivative values recorded in AOCI are immediately recognized in earnings. JPMorgan Chase uses net investment hedges to protect the value of the Firm’s net investments in certain non-U.S. subsidiaries or branches whose functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar. For qualifying net investment hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivatives due to changes in spot foreign exchange rates are recorded in OCI as translation adjustments. Amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recorded directly in earnings.

Derivative receivables and payables, as well as the related cash collateral from the same counterparty, have been netted on the Consolidated balance sheets where the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the master netting agreement. Where such a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained, amounts are not eligible for netting on the Consolidated balance sheets, and those derivative receivables and payables are shown separately in the tables below. In addition to the cash collateral received and transferred that is presented on a net basis with derivative receivables and payables, the Firm receives and transfers additional collateral (financial instruments and cash). These amounts mitigate counterparty credit risk associated with the Firm’s derivative instruments, but are not eligible for net presentation: • collateral that consists of liquid securities and other cash collateral held at third-party custodians, which are shown separately as \"Collateral not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets\" in the tables below, up to the fair value exposure amount. For the purpose of this disclosure, the definition of liquid securities is consistent with the definition of high quality liquid assets as defined in the LCR rule; • the amount of collateral held or transferred that exceeds the fair value exposure at the individual counterparty level, as of the date presented, which is excluded from the tables below; and • collateral held or transferred that relates to derivative receivables or payables where an appropriate legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained with respect to the master netting agreement, which is excluded from the tables below. 2023 2022 December 31, (in millions) Gross derivative receivables Amounts netted on the Consolidated balance sheets Net derivative receivables Gross derivative receivables Amounts netted on the Consolidated balance sheets Net derivative receivables U.S. GAAP nettable derivative receivables Interest rate contracts: OTC $ 176,901 $ (152,703) $ 24,198 $ 203,922 $ (178,261) $ 25,661 OTC–cleared 71,419 (71,275) 144 93,800 (93,424) 376 Exchange-traded(a) 402 (389) 13 559 (311) 248 Total interest rate contracts 248,722 (224,367) 24,355 298,281 (271,996) 26,285 Credit contracts: OTC 7,637 (7,226) 411 8,474 (7,535) 939 OTC–cleared 1,904 (1,877) 27 1,746 (1,704) 42 Total credit contracts 9,541 (9,103) 438 10,220 (9,239) 981 Foreign exchange contracts: OTC 203,624 (187,295) 16,329 237,941 (216,796) 21,145 OTC–cleared 469 (459) 10 1,461 (1,417) 44 Exchange-traded(a) 6 (2) 4 15 (1) 14 Total foreign exchange contracts 204,099 (187,756) 16,343 239,417 (218,214) 21,203 Equity contracts: OTC 25,001 (23,677) 1,324 30,323 (25,665) 4,658 Exchange-traded(a) 30,462 (29,084) 1,378 28,467 (27,109) 1,358 Total equity contracts 55,463 (52,761) 2,702 58,790 (52,774) 6,016 Commodity contracts: OTC 8,049 (5,084) 2,965 14,430 (7,633) 6,797 OTC–cleared 133 (123) 10 120 (112) 8 Exchange-traded(a) 5,214 (5,190) 24 9,103 (8,745) 358 Total commodity contracts 13,396 (10,397) 2,999 23,653 (16,490) 7,163 Derivative receivables with appropriate legal opinion 531,221 (484,384) 46,837 (d) 630,361 (568,713) 61,648 (d) Derivative receivables where an appropriate legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained 8,027 8,027 9,232 9,232 Total derivative receivables recognized on the Consolidated balance sheets $ 539,248 $ 54,864 $ 639,593 $ 70,880 Collateral not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets(b)(c) (22,461) (23,014) Net amounts $ 32,403 $ 47,866 Notes to consolidated financial statements 208 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K 2023 20222023 2022 2023 2022 December 31, (in millions) Gross derivative payables Amounts netted on the Consolidated balance sheets Net derivative payables Gross derivative payables Amounts netted on the Consolidated balance sheets Net derivative payables U.S. GAAP nettable derivative payables Interest rate contracts: OTC $ 161,901 $ (152,467) $ 9,434 $ 190,108 $ (176,890) $ 13,218 OTC–cleared 76,007 (75,729) 278 97,417 (97,126) 291 Exchange-traded(a) 436 (390) 46 327 (305) 22 Total interest rate contracts 238,344 (228,586) 9,758 287,852 (274,321) 13,531 Credit contracts: OTC 10,332 (9,313) 1,019 8,054 (7,572) 482 OTC–cleared 1,639 (1,636) 3 1,674 (1,645) 29 Total credit contracts 11,971 (10,949) 1,022 9,728 (9,217) 511 Foreign exchange contracts: OTC 209,386 (199,173) 10,213 246,457 (231,248) 15,209 OTC–cleared 552 (470) 82 1,488 (1,417) 71 Exchange-traded(a) 6 — 6 20 — 20 Total foreign exchange contracts 209,944 (199,643) 10,301 247,965 (232,665) 15,300 Equity contracts: OTC 29,999 (27,360) 2,639 29,833 (26,554) 3,279 Exchange-traded(a) 33,137 (29,083) 4,054 28,291 (27,103) 1,188 Total equity contracts 63,136 (56,443) 6,693 58,124 (53,657) 4,467 Commodity contracts: OTC 8,788 (5,192) 3,596 11,954 (7,642) 4,312 OTC–cleared 120 (120) — 112 (112) — Exchange-traded(a) 5,376 (5,192) 184 9,021 (8,758) 263 Total commodity contracts 14,284 (10,504) 3,780 21,087 (16,512) 4,575 Derivative payables with appropriate legal opinion 537,679 (506,125) 31,554 (d) 624,756 (586,372) 38,384 (d) Derivative payables where an appropriate legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained 9,293 9,293 12,757 12,757 Total derivative payables recognized on the Consolidated balance sheets $ 546,972 $ 40,847 $ 637,513 $ 51,141 Collateral not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets(b)(c) (4,547) (3,318) Net amounts $ 36,300 $ 47,823 (a) Exchange-traded derivative balances that relate to futures contracts are settled daily.

Net derivatives payable included cash collateral netted of $70.0 billion and $69.2 billion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Derivative cash collateral relates to OTC and OTC-cleared derivative instruments. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K 209 2023 20222023 2022 Liquidity risk and credit-related contingent features In addition to the specific market risks introduced by each derivative contract type, derivatives expose JPMorgan Chase to credit risk — the risk that derivative counterparties may fail to meet their payment obligations under the derivative contracts and the collateral, if any, held by the Firm proves to be of insufficient value to cover the payment obligation. It is the policy of JPMorgan Chase to actively pursue, where possible, the use of legally enforceable master netting arrangements and collateral agreements to mitigate derivative counterparty credit risk inherent in derivative receivables. While derivative receivables expose the Firm to credit risk, derivative payables expose the Firm to liquidity risk, as the derivative contracts typically require the Firm to post cash or securities collateral with counterparties as the fair value of the contracts moves in the counterparties’ favor or upon specified downgrades in the Firm’s and its subsidiaries’ respective credit ratings. Certain derivative contracts also provide for termination of the contract, generally upon a downgrade of either the Firm or the counterparty, at the fair value of the derivative contracts. The following table shows the aggregate fair value of net derivative payables related to OTC and OTC-cleared derivatives that contain contingent collateral or termination features that may be triggered upon a ratings downgrade, and the associated collateral the Firm has posted in the normal course of business, at December 31, 2023 and 2022. OTC and OTC-cleared derivative payables containing downgrade triggers (in millions) December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 Aggregate fair value of net derivative payables $ 14,655 $ 16,023 Collateral posted 14,673 15,505 The following table shows the impact of a single-notch and two-notch downgrade of the long-term issuer ratings of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries, predominantly JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., at December 31, 2023 and 2022, related to OTC and OTC-cleared derivative contracts with contingent collateral or termination features that may be triggered upon a ratings downgrade. Derivatives contracts generally require additional collateral to be posted or terminations to be triggered when the predefined rating threshold is breached. A downgrade by a single rating agency that does not result in a rating lower than a preexisting corresponding rating provided by another major rating agency will generally not result in additional collateral (except in certain instances in which additional initial margin may be required upon a ratings downgrade), nor in termination payment requirements. The liquidity impact in the table is calculated based upon a downgrade below the lowest current rating of the rating agencies referred to in the derivative contract. Liquidity impact of downgrade triggers on OTC and OTC-cleared derivatives December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 (in millions) Single-notch downgrade Two-notch downgrade Single-notch downgrade Two-notch downgrade Amount of additional collateral to be posted upon downgrade(a) $ 75 $ 1,153 $ 128 $ 1,293 Amount required to settle contracts with termination triggers upon downgrade(b) 93 592 88 925 (a) Includes the additional collateral to be posted for initial margin. (b) Amounts represent fair values of derivative payables, and do not reflect collateral posted. Derivatives executed in contemplation of a sale of the underlying financial asset In certain instances the Firm enters into transactions in which it transfers financial assets but maintains the economic exposure to the transferred assets by entering into a derivative with the same counterparty in contemplation of the initial transfer. The Firm generally accounts for such transfers as collateralized financing transactions as described in Note 11, but in limited circumstances they may qualify to be accounted for as a sale and a derivative under U.S. GAAP. The amount of such transfers accounted for as a sale where the associated derivative was outstanding was not material at both December 31, 2023 and 2022.

Excludes the accrual of interest on interest rate swaps and the related hedged items. (c) Primarily consists of hedges of the foreign currency risk of long-term debt and AFS securities for changes in spot foreign currency rates. Gains and losses related to the derivatives and the hedged items due to changes in foreign currency rates and the income statement impact of excluded components were recorded primarily in principal transactions revenue and net interest income. (d) Consists of overall fair value hedges of physical commodities inventories that are generally carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value (net realizable value approximates fair value). Gains and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue. (e) The assessment of hedge effectiveness excludes certain components of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and hedged items such as forward points on foreign exchange forward contracts, time values and cross-currency basis spreads. Excluded components may impact earnings either through amortization of the initial amount over the life of the derivative or through fair value changes recognized in the current period. (f) Represents the change in value of amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness under the amortization approach, predominantly cross- currency basis spreads.

As a result of the application of hedge accounting, these inventories are carried at fair value, thus recognizing unrealized gains and losses in current periods. Since the Firm exits these positions at fair value, there is no incremental impact to net income in future periods. (b) Excludes hedged items where only foreign currency risk is the designated hedged risk, as basis adjustments related to foreign currency hedges will not reverse through the income statement in future periods. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the carrying amount excluded for AFS securities is $ 19.3 billion and $20.3 billion, respectively, and for long-term debt is zero and $221 million, respectively. (c) Carrying amo unt represents the amortized cost, net of allowance if applicable. Effective January 1, 2023, the Firm adopted the portfolio layer method hedge accounting guidance. At December 31, 2023, the amortized cost of the portfolio layer method closed portfolios was $83.9 billion, of which $68.0 billion was designated as hedged. The amount designated as hedged is the sum of the notional amounts of all outstanding layers in each portfolio, which includes both spot starting and forward starting layers. The cumulative amount of basis adjustments was $(165) million, which is comprised of $73 million and $ (238) million for active and discontinued hedging relationships, respectively. Refer to Note 1 and Note 10 for additional information. (d) Positive (negative) amounts related to assets represent cumulative fair value hedge basis adjustments that will reduce (increase) net interest income in future periods.

Gains and losses were recorded in net interest income. (b) Primarily consists of hedges of the foreign currency risk of non-U.S. dollar-denominated revenue and expense. The income statement classification of gains and losses follows the hedged item – primarily noninterest revenue and compensation expense. The Firm did not experience any forecasted transactions that failed to occur for the years ended 2023, 2022 and 2021. Over the next 12 months, the Firm expects that approximately $(1.6) billion (after-tax) of net losses recorded in AOCI at December 31, 2023, related to cash flow hedges will be recognized in income. For cash flow hedges that have been terminated, the maximum length of time over which the derivative results recorded in AOCI will be recognized in earnings is approximately six years, corresponding to the timing of the originally hedged forecasted cash flows. For open cash flow hedges, the maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are hedged is approximately seven years. The Firm’s longer-dated forecasted transactions relate to core lending and borrowing activities. Net investment hedge gains and losses The following table presents hedging instruments, by contract type, that were used in net investment hedge accounting relationships, and the pre-tax gains/(losses) recorded on such instruments for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021. 2023 2022 2021 Year ended December 31, (in millions) Amounts recorded in income(a)(b) Amounts recorded in OCI Amounts recorded in income(a)(b) Amounts recorded in OCI Amounts recorded in income(a)(b) Amounts recorded in OCI Foreign exchange derivatives $384 $(1,732) $(123) $3,591 $(228) $2,452 (a) Certain components of hedging derivatives are permitted to be excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness, such as forward points on foreign exchange forward contracts. The Firm elects to record changes in fair value of these amounts directly in other income. (b) Excludes amounts reclassified from AOCI to income on the sale or liquidation of hedged entities. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Firm reclassified a net pre-tax loss of $(35) million to other revenue including the impact of the acquisition of CIFM. The Firm reclassified net pre-tax gains of $38 million to other income/expense related to the liquidation of certain legal entities during the year ended December 31, 2022. The amount reclassified for the year ended December 31, 2021 was not material. Refer to Note 24 for further information.

Gains and losses were recorded predominantly in mortgage fees and related income. (b) Relates to credit derivatives used to mitigate credit risk associated with lending exposures in the Firm’s wholesale businesses. These derivatives do not include credit derivatives used to mitigate counterparty credit risk arising from derivative receivables, which is included in gains and losses on derivatives related to market-making activities and other derivatives. Gains and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue. (c) Primarily relates to derivatives used to mitigate foreign exchange risk of specified foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities. Gains and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue. Gains and losses on derivatives related to market-making activities and other derivatives The Firm makes markets in derivatives in order to meet the needs of customers and uses derivatives to manage certain risks associated with net open risk positions from its market-making activities, including the counterparty credit risk arising from derivative receivables. All derivatives not included in the hedge accounting or specified risk management categories above are included in this category. Gains and losses on these derivatives are primarily recorded in principal transactions revenue. Refer to Note 6 for information on principal transactions revenue. Credit derivatives Credit derivatives are financial instruments whose value is derived from the credit risk associated with the debt of a third-party issuer (the reference entity) and which allow one party (the protection purchaser) to transfer that risk to another party (the protection seller). Credit derivatives expose the protection purchaser to the creditworthiness of the protection seller, as the protection seller is required to make payments under the contract when the reference entity experiences a credit event, such as a bankruptcy, a failure to pay its obligation or a restructuring. The seller of credit protection receives a premium for providing protection but has the risk that the underlying instrument referenced in the contract will be subject to a credit event. The Firm is both a purchaser and seller of protection in the credit derivatives market and uses these derivatives for two primary purposes. First, in its capacity as a market-maker, the Firm actively manages a portfolio of credit derivatives by purchasing and selling credit protection, predominantly on corporate debt obligations, to meet the needs of customers. Second, as an end-user, the Firm uses credit derivatives to manage credit risk associated with lending exposures (loans and unfunded commitments) in its wholesale and consumer businesses and derivatives counterparty exposures in its wholesale businesses, and to manage the credit risk arising from certain financial instruments in the Firm’s market-making businesses. Following is a summary of various types of credit derivatives. Notes to consolidated financial statements 214 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K Derivatives gains/(losses) recorded in income Derivatives gains/(losses) recorded in income Credit default swaps Credit derivatives may reference the credit of either a single reference entity (“single-name”), broad-based index or portfolio. The Firm purchases and sells protection on both single- name and index-reference obligations. Single-name CDS and index CDS contracts are either OTC or OTC-cleared derivative contracts. Single-name CDS are used to manage the default risk of a single reference entity, while index CDS contracts are used to manage the credit risk associated with the broader credit markets or credit market segments. Like the S&P 500 and other market indices, a CDS index consists of a portfolio of CDS across many reference entities. New series of CDS indices are periodically established with a new underlying portfolio of reference entities to reflect changes in the credit markets. If one of the reference entities in the index experiences a credit event, then the reference entity that defaulted is removed from the index. CDS can also be referenced against specific portfolios of reference names or against customized exposure levels: for example, to provide protection against the first $1 million of realized credit losses in a $10 million portfolio of exposure. Such structures are commonly known as tranche CDS. For both single-name CDS contracts and index CDS contracts, upon the occurrence of a credit event, under the terms of a CDS contract neither party to the CDS contract has recourse to the reference entity. The protection purchaser has recourse to the protection seller for the difference between the face value of the CDS contract and the fair value of the reference obligation at settlement of the credit derivative contract, also known as the recovery value. The protection purchaser does not need to hold the debt instrument of the underlying reference entity in order to receive amounts due under the CDS contract when a credit event occurs. Credit-related notes A credit-related note is a funded derivative with a credit risk component where the issuer of the credit-related note purchases from the note investor credit protection on a reference entity or an index. Under the contract, the investor pays the issuer the par value of the note at the inception of the transaction, and in return, the issuer makes periodic payments to the investor, based on the credit risk of the referenced entity. The issuer also repays the investor the par value of the note at maturity unless the reference entity (or one of the entities that makes up a reference index) experiences a specified credit event. If a credit event occurs, the issuer is not obligated to repay the par value of the note, but rather, the issuer pays the investor the difference between the par value of the note and the fair value of the defaulted reference obligation at the time of settlement. Neither party to the credit-related note has recourse to the defaulting reference entity. The following tables present a summary of the notional amounts of credit derivatives and credit-related notes the Firm sold and purchased as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. Upon a credit event, the Firm as a seller of protection would typically pay out a percentage of the full notional amount of net protection sold, as the amount actually required to be paid on the contracts takes into account the recovery value of the reference obligation at the time of settlement. The Firm manages the credit risk on contracts to sell protection by purchasing protection with identical or similar underlying reference entities. Other purchased protection referenced in the following tables includes credit derivatives bought on related, but not identical, reference positions (including indices, portfolio coverage and other reference points) as well as protection purchased by CIB through credit-related notes. Other purchased protection also includes credit protection against certain loans in the retained lending portfolio through the issuance of credit derivatives and credit-related notes. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K 215 The Firm does not use notional amounts of credit derivatives as the primary measure of risk management for such derivatives, because the notional amount does not take into account the probability of the occurrence of a credit event, the recovery value of the reference obligation, or related cash instruments and economic hedges, each of which reduces, in the Firm’s view, the risks associated with such derivatives.

(b) Predominantly represents Other protection purchased by CIB. (c) Represents the total notional amount of protection purchased where the underlying reference instrument is identical to the reference instrument on protection sold; the notional amount of protection purchased for each individual identical underlying reference instrument may be greater or lower than the notional amount of protection sold. (d) Does not take into account the fair value of the reference obligation at the time of settlement, which would generally reduce the amount the seller of protection pays to the buyer of protection in determining settlement value. (e) Represents protection purchased by the Firm on referenced instruments (single-name, portfolio or index) where the Firm has not sold any protection on the identical reference instrument. The following tables summarize the notional amounts by the ratings, maturity profile, and total fair value, of credit derivatives as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, where JPMorgan Chase is the seller of protection. The maturity profile is based on the remaining contractual maturity of the credit derivative contracts. The ratings profile is based on the rating of the reference entity on which the credit derivative contract is based. The ratings and maturity profile of credit derivatives where JPMorgan Chase is the purchaser of protection are comparable to the profile reflected below.

The related contracts are often terminable on demand and the Firm has no remaining obligation to deliver future services. For arrangements with a fixed term, the Firm may commit to deliver services in the future. Revenue associated with these remaining performance obligations typically depends on the occurrence of future events or underlying asset values, and is not recognized until the outcome of those events or values are known. Investment banking fees This revenue category includes debt and equity underwriting and advisory fees. As an underwriter, the Firm helps clients raise capital via public offering and private placement of various types of debt and equity instruments. Underwriting fees are primarily based on the issuance price and quantity of the underlying instruments, and are recognized as revenue typically upon execution of the client’s transaction. The Firm also manages and syndicates loan arrangements. Credit arrangement and syndication fees, included within debt underwriting fees, are recorded as revenue after satisfying certain retention, timing and yield criteria. The Firm also provides advisory services, by assisting its clients with mergers and acquisitions, divestitures, restructuring and other complex transactions. Advisory fees are recognized as revenue typically upon execution of the client’s transaction. The following table presents the components of investment banking fees.

Principal transactions Principal transactions revenue is driven by many factors, including: • the bid-offer spread, which is the difference between the price at which a market participant is willing and able to sell an instrument to the Firm and the price at which another market participant is willing and able to buy it from the Firm, and vice versa; and • realized and unrealized gains and losses on financial instruments and commodities transactions, including those accounted for under the fair value option, primarily used in client-driven market-making activities. – Realized gains and losses result from the sale of instruments, closing out or termination of transactions, or interim cash payments. – Unrealized gains and losses result from changes in valuation. In connection with its client-driven market-making activities, the Firm transacts in debt and equity instruments, derivatives and commodities, including physical commodities inventories and financial instruments that reference commodities. Principal transactions revenue also includes realized and unrealized gains and losses related to: • derivatives designated in qualifying hedge accounting relationships, primarily fair value hedges of commodity and foreign exchange risk; • derivatives used for specific risk management purposes, primarily to mitigate credit, foreign exchange and interest rate risks. Refer to Note 5 for further information on the income statement classification of gains and losses from derivatives activities. In the financial commodity markets, the Firm transacts in OTC derivatives (e.g., swaps, forwards, options) and ETD that reference a wide range of underlying commodities. In the physical commodity markets, the Firm primarily purchases and sells precious and base metals and may hold other commodities inventories under financing and other arrangements with clients. The following table presents all realized and unrealized gains and losses recorded in principal transactions revenue. This table excludes interest income and interest expense on trading assets and liabilities, which are an integral part of the overall performance of the Firm’s client-driven market- making activities in CIB and fund deployment activities in Treasury and CIO. Refer to Note 7 for further information on interest income and interest expense. Trading revenue is presented primarily by instrument type. The Firm’s client-driven market-making businesses generally utilize a variety of instrument types in connection with their market-making and related risk-management activities; accordingly, the trading revenue presented in the table below is not representative of the total revenue of any individual LOB.

(c) Includes net markdowns on held-for-sale positions, primarily unfunded commitments, in the bridge financing portfolio. Principal transactions revenue is earned primarily by CIB. Lending- and deposit-related fees Lending-related fees include fees earned from loan commitments, standby letters of credit, financial guarantees, and other loan-servicing activities. Deposit- related fees include fees earned from performing cash management activities, and providing overdraft and other deposit account services. Lending- and deposit-related fees are recognized over the period in which the related service is provided. Refer to Note 28 for further information on lending-related commitments. The following table presents the components of lending- and deposit-related fees. Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2023 2022 2021 Lending-related fees $ 2,365 (a) $ 1,468 $ 1,472 Deposit-related fees 5,048 5,630 5,560 Total lending- and deposit-related fees $ 7,413 $ 7,098 $ 7,032 (a) Includes the amortization of the purchase discount on certain acquired lending-related commitments associated with First Republic, predominantly in AWM and CB. The discount is deferred in other liabilities and recognized on a straight-line basis over the commitment period and was largely recognized in the current year as the commitments are generally short term. Refer to Note 34 for additional information. Lending- and deposit-related fees are earned by CCB, CIB, CB, and AWM. Asset management fees Investment management fees include fees associated with assets the Firm manages on behalf of its clients, including investors in Firm-sponsored funds and owners of separately managed investment accounts. Management fees are typically based on the value of assets under management and are collected and recognized at the end of each period over which the management services are provided and the value of the managed assets is known. The Firm also receives performance-based management fees, which are earned based on exceeding certain benchmarks or other performance targets and are accrued and recognized when the probability of reversal is remote, typically at the end of the related billing period. All other asset management fees include commissions earned on the sales or distribution of mutual funds to clients. These fees are recorded as revenue at the time the service is rendered or, in the case of certain distribution fees, based on the underlying fund’s asset value or investor redemption activity. The following table presents the components of asset management fees. Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2023 2022 2021 Asset management fees Investment management fees $ 14,908 (a) $ 13,765 $ 14,027 All other asset management fees 312 331 378 Total asset management fees $ 15,220 $ 14,096 $ 14,405 (a) Includes the impact of First Republic. Refer to Note 34 for additional information. Asset management fees earned primarily by AWM and CCB. Commissions and other fees This revenue category includes commissions and fees from brokerage and custody services, and other products. Brokerage commissions represents commissions earned when the Firm acts as a broker, by facilitating its clients’ purchases and sales of securities and other financial instruments. Brokerage commissions are collected and recognized as revenue upon occurrence of the client transaction. The Firm reports certain costs paid to third- party clearing houses and exchanges net against commission revenue. Administration fees predominantly include fees for custody, funds services, securities lending and securities clearance. These fees are recorded as revenue over the period in which the related service is provided. Notes to consolidated financial statements 218 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K The following table presents the components of commissions and other fees.

Commissions and other fees are earned primarily by CIB, CCB and AWM. Mortgage fees and related income This revenue category reflects CCB’s Home Lending production and net mortgage servicing revenue. Production revenue includes fees and income recognized as earned on mortgage loans originated with the intent to sell, and the impact of risk management activities associated with the mortgage pipeline and warehouse loans. Production revenue also includes gains and losses on sales and lower of cost or fair value adjustments on mortgage loans held-for-sale (excluding certain repurchased loans insured by U.S. government agencies), and changes in the fair value of financial instruments measured under the fair value option. Net mortgage servicing revenue includes operating revenue earned from servicing third-party mortgage loans, which is recognized over the period in which the service is provided; changes in the fair value of MSRs; the impact of risk management activities associated with MSRs; and gains and losses on securitization of excess mortgage servicing. Net mortgage servicing revenue also includes gains and losses on sales and lower of cost or fair value adjustments of certain repurchased loans insured by U.S. government agencies. Refer to Note 15 for further information on risk management activities and MSRs. Net interest income from mortgage loans is recorded in interest income. Card income This revenue category includes interchange and other income from credit and debit card transactions; and fees earned from processing card transactions for merchants, both of which are recognized when purchases are made by a cardholder and presented net of certain transaction- related costs. Card income also includes account origination costs and annual fees, which are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over a 12-month period. Certain credit card products offer the cardholder the ability to earn points based on account activity, which the cardholder can choose to redeem for cash and non-cash rewards. The cost to the Firm related to these proprietary rewards programs varies based on multiple factors including the terms and conditions of the rewards programs, cardholder activity, cardholder reward redemption rates and cardholder reward selections. The Firm maintains a liability for its obligations under its rewards programs and reports the current-period cost as a reduction of card income. Credit card revenue sharing agreements The Firm has contractual agreements with numerous co- brand partners that grant the Firm exclusive rights to issue co-branded credit card products and market them to the customers of such partners. These partners endorse the co- brand credit card programs and provide their customer or member lists to the Firm. The partners may also conduct marketing activities and provide rewards redeemable under their own loyalty programs that the Firm will grant to co- brand credit cardholders based on account activity. The terms of these agreements generally range from five to ten years. The Firm typically makes payments to the co-brand credit card partners based on the cost of partners’ marketing activities and loyalty program rewards provided to credit cardholders, new account originations and sales volumes. Payments to partners based on marketing efforts undertaken by the partners are expensed by the Firm as incurred and reported as marketing expense. Payments for partner loyalty program rewards are reported as a reduction of card income when incurred. Payments to partners based on new credit card account originations are accounted for as direct loan origination costs and are deferred and recognized as a reduction of card income on a straight-line basis over a 12-month period. Payments to partners based on sales volumes are reported as a reduction of card income when the related interchange income is earned. The following table presents the components of card income: Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2023 2022 2021 Interchange and merchant processing income $ 31,021 $ 28,085 $ 23,592 Reward costs and partner payments (24,601) (22,162) (17,868) All other(a) (1,636) (1,503) (622) Total card income $ 4,784 $ 4,420 $ 5,102 (a) Predominantly represents the amortization of account origination costs and annual fees, which are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over a 12-month period. Card income is earned primarily by CCB, CIB and CB. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K 219 Other income This revenue category includes operating lease income, as well as losses associated with the Firm’s tax-oriented investments, predominantly alternative energy equity- method investments in CIB. The losses associated with these tax-oriented investments are more than offset by lower income tax expense from the associated tax credits. The following table presents certain components of other income: Operating lease income $ 2,843 $ 3,654 $ 4,914 Losses on tax-oriented investments (1,538) (1,491) (1,570) Estimated bargain purchase gain associated with the First Republic acquisition 2,775 (a) — — Gain related to the acquisition of CIFM 339 (b) — — Gain on sale of Visa B shares — 914 — Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2023 2022 2021 (a) Refer to Note 34 for additional information on the First Republic acquisition.

Refer to Note 34 for additional information on the First Republic acquisition. FDIC Special Assessment In November 2023, the FDIC approved a final rule to implement a special assessment intended to recover losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”) arising from the protection of uninsured depositors resulting from the systemic risk determination made on March 12, 2023. The final rule imposed a special assessment at a quarterly rate of 3.36 basis points on insured depository institutions whose estimated uninsured deposits were over $5.0 billion as of December 31, 2022. In the fourth quarter of 2023, the Firm recognized the estimated special assessment expense of $2.9 billion (pre-tax). Refer to Note 32 for additional information on noninterest revenue and expense by segment. Notes to consolidated financial statements 220 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K Note 7 – Interest income and Interest expense Interest income and interest expense are recorded in the Consolidated statements of income and classified based on the nature of the underlying asset or liability. Interest income and interest expense includes the current- period interest accruals for financial instruments measured at fair value, except for derivatives and financial instruments containing embedded derivatives that would be separately accounted for in accordance with U.S. GAAP, absent the fair value option election; for those instruments, all changes in fair value including any interest elements, are primarily reported in principal transactions revenue. For financial instruments that are not measured at fair value, the related interest is included within interest income or interest expense, as applicable. Interest income on loans and securities include the amortization and accretion of purchase premiums and discounts, as well as net deferred fees and costs on loans. These amounts are deferred in loans and investment securities, respectively, and recognized on a level-yield basis. Refer to Notes 10, 11, 12, and 20 for further information on accounting for interest income and interest expense related to investment securities, securities financing activities (i.e., securities purchased or sold under resale or repurchase agreements; securities borrowed; and securities loaned), loans and long-term debt, respectively.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K 221 Note 8 – Pension and other postretirement employee benefit plans The Firm has various defined benefit pension plans and OPEB plans that provide benefits to its employees in the U.S. and certain non-U.S. locations. Substantially all the defined benefit pension plans are closed to new participants. The principal defined benefit pension plan in the U.S., which covered substantially all U.S. employees, was closed to new participants and frozen for existing participants on January 1, 2020, (and January 1, 2019 for new hires on or after December 2, 2017). Interest credits continue to accrue to participants’ accounts based on their accumulated balances. The Firm maintains funded and unfunded postretirement benefit plans that provide medical and life insurance for certain eligible employees and retirees as well as their dependents covered under these programs. None of these plans have a material impact on the Firm’s Consolidated Financial Statements. The Firm also provides a qualified defined contribution plan in the U.S. and maintains other similar arrangements in certain non-U.S. locations. The most significant of these plans is the JPMorgan Chase 401(k) Savings Plan (“the 401(k) Savings Plan”), which covers substantially all U.S. employees. Employees can contribute to the 401(k) Savings Plan on a pretax and/or Roth 401(k) after-tax basis. The Firm makes annual matching and pay credit contributions to the 401(k) Savings Plan on behalf of eligible participants. The following table presents the pretax benefit obligations, plan assets, the net funded status, and the amounts recorded in AOCI on the Consolidated balance sheets for the Firm’s significant defined benefit pension and OPEB plans. As of or for the year ended December 31, Defined benefit pension and OPEB plans (in millions) 2023 2022 Projected benefit obligations $ (14,740) $ (13,545) Fair value of plan assets 22,013 19,890 Net funded status 7,273 6,345 Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) (1,517) (1,916) The weighted-average discount rate used to value the benefit obligations as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, was 5.16% and 5.14%, respectively. Gains and losses Gains or losses resulting from changes in the benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets are recorded in OCI. Amortization of net gains or losses are recognized a s part of the net periodic benefit cost over subsequent periods, if, as of the beginning of the year, the net gain or loss exceeds 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the fair value of the plan assets. Amortization is generally over the average expected remaining lifetime of plan participants, given the frozen status of most plans. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the net gain was attributable to market-driven increases in the fair value of plan assets, partially offset by changes in the discount rate and interest crediting rate. During the year ended December 31, 2022, a remeasurement of the Firm’s U.S. principal defined benefit plan in the third quarter, was required as a result of a pension settlement. The remeasurement resulted in a reduction in the fair value of the Firm’s U.S. principal defined benefit plan assets, reflecting market conditions at the time of remeasurement, and a reduction in the plan’s projected benefit obligation totaling $4.0 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively, resulting in a net decrease of $1.4 billion in pre-tax AOCI. The following table presents the net periodic benefit costs reported in the Consolidated statements of income for the Firm’s defined benefit pension, defined contribution and OPEB plans, and in other comprehensive income for the defined benefit pension and OPEB plans. Pension and OPEB plans Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2023 2022 2021 Total net periodic defined benefit plan cost/(credit)(a) $ (393) $ (192) (b) $ (201) (b) Total defined contribution plans 1,609 1,408 1,333 Total pension and OPEB cost included in noninterest expense $ 1,216 $ 1,216 $ 1,132 Total recognized in other comprehensive (income)/loss $ (421) $ 1,459 $ (1,129) (a) The service cost component of net periodic defined benefit cost is reported in compensation expense; all other components of net periodic defined benefit costs are reported in other expense in the Consolidated statements of income. (b) Includes pension settlement losses of $92 million and $33 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. Notes to consolidated financial statements 222 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K Defined benefit pension and OPEB plans Pension and OPEB plansPension and OPEB plans The following table presents the weighted-average actuarial assumptions used to determine the net periodic benefit costs for the defined benefit pension and OPEB plans. Defined benefit pension and OPEB plans Year ended December 31, 2023 2022 2021 Discount rate 5.14 % 2.54 % 2.17 % Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets 5.74 % 3.68 % 2.97 % Plan assumptions The Firm’s expected long-term rate of return is a blended weighted average, by asset allocation of the projected long- term returns for the various asset classes, taking into consideration local market conditions and the specific allocation of plan assets. Returns on asset classes are developed using a forward-looking approach and are not strictly based on historical returns, with consideration given to current market conditions and the portfolio mix of each plan. The discount rates used in determining the benefit obligations are generally provided by the Firm’s actuaries, with the Firm’s principal defined benefit pension plan using a rate that was selected by reference to the yields on portfolios of bonds with maturity dates and coupons that closely match each of the plan’s projected cash flows. Investment strategy and asset allocation The assets of the Firm’s defined benefit pension plans are held in various trusts and are invested in well-diversified portfolios of equity and fixed income securities, cash and cash equivalents, and alternative investments. The Firm regularly reviews the asset allocations and asset managers, as well as other factors that could impact the portfolios, which are rebalanced when deemed necessary. As of December 31, 2023, the approved asset allocation ranges by asset class for the Firm’s principal defined benefit plan are 42-100% debt securities, 0-40% equity securities, 0-2% real estate, and 0-10% alternatives. Assets held by the Firm’s defined benefit pension and OPEB plans do not include securities issued by JPMorgan Chase or its affiliates, except through indirect exposures through investments in exchange traded funds, mutual funds and collective investment funds managed by third-parties. The defined benefit pension and OPEB plans hold investments that are sponsored or managed by affiliates of JPMorgan Chase in the amount of $1.8 billion and $1.7 billion, as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Fair value measurement of the plans’ assets and liabilities Refer to Note 2 for information on fair value measurements, including descriptions of level 1, 2, and 3 of the fair value hierarchy and the valuation methods employed by the Firm.

The decline in 2022 was due to $501 million in unrealized losses and $54 million in settlements. Estimated future benefit payments The following table presents benefit payments expected to be paid for the defined benefit pension and OPEB plans for the years indicated.

Under the terms of the LTIP, as of December 31, 2023, 54 million shares of common stock were available for issuance through May 2025. The LTIP is the only active plan under which the Firm is currently granting share-based incentive awards. In the following discussion, the LTIP, plus prior Firm plans and plans assumed as the result of acquisitions, are referred to collectively as the “LTI Plans,” and such plans constitute the Firm’s share-based incentive plans. RSUs are awarded at no cost to the recipient upon their grant. Generally, RSUs are granted annually and vest at a rate of 50% after two years and 50% after three years and are converted into shares of common stock as of the vesting date. In addition, RSUs typically include full-career eligibility provisions, which allow employees to continue to vest upon voluntary termination based on age and/or service-related requirements, subject to post-employment and other restrictions. All RSU awards are subject to forfeiture until vested and contain clawback provisions that may result in cancellation under certain specified circumstances. Predominantly all RSUs entitle the recipient to receive cash payments equivalent to any dividends paid on the underlying common stock during the period the RSUs are outstanding. Performance share units (“PSUs”) are granted annually, and approved by the Firm’s Board of Directors, to members of the Firm’s Operating Committee under the variable compensation program. PSUs are subject to the Firm’s achievement of specified performance criteria over a three- year period. The number of awards that vest can range from zero to 150% of the grant amount. In addition, dividends that accrue during the vesting period are reinvested in dividend equivalent share units. PSUs and the related dividend equivalent share units are converted into shares of common stock after vesting. Once the PSUs and dividend equivalent share units have vested, the shares of common stock that are delivered, after applicable tax withholding, must be retained for an additional holding period, for a total combined vesting and holding period of approximately five to eight years from the grant date depending on regulations in certain countries. Under the LTI Plans, stock appreciation rights (“SARs”) were generally granted with an exercise price equal to the fair value of JPMorgan Chase’s common stock on the grant date. SARs generally expire ten years after the grant date. In 2021, the Firm awarded its Chairman and CEO and its President and Chief Operating Officer 1.5 million and 750,000 SARs, respectively. There were no grants of SARs in 2023 or 2022. The Firm separately recognizes compensation expense for each tranche of each award, net of estimated forfeitures, as if it were a separate award with its own vesting date. Generally, for each tranche granted, compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis from the grant date until the vesting date of the respective tranche, provided that the employees will not become full-career eligible during the vesting period. For awards with full-career eligibility provisions and awards granted with no future substantive service requirement, the Firm accrues the estimated value of awards expected to be awarded to employees as of the grant date without giving consideration to the impact of post-employment restrictions. For each tranche granted to employees who will become full-career eligible during the vesting period, compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis from the grant date until the earlier of the employee’s full-career eligibility date or the vesting date of the respective tranche. The Firm’s policy for issuing shares upon settlement of employee share-based incentive awards is to issue either new shares of common stock or treasury shares. During 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Firm settled all of its employee share-based awards by issuing treasury shares. Refer to Note 23 for further information on the classification of share-based awards for purposes of calculating earnings per share. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K 225 RSUs, PSUs and SARs activity Generally, compensation expense for RSUs and PSUs is measured based on the number of units granted multiplied by the stock price at the grant date, and for SARs, is measured at the grant date using the Black-Scholes valuation model. Compensation expense for these awards is recognized in net income as described previously. The following table summarizes JPMorgan Chase’s RSUs, PSUs and SARs activity for 2023. RSUs/PSUs SARs Year ended December 31, 2023 Number of units Weighted- average grant date fair value Number of awards Weighted- average exercise price Weighted-average remaining contractual life (in years) Aggregate intrinsic value (in thousands, except weighted-average data, and where otherwise stated) Outstanding, January 1 47,726 $ 139.90 2,511 $ 141.19 Granted 23,758 139.39 — — Exercised or vested (17,773) 134.86 (261) 46.58 Forfeited (1,468) 142.11 — — Canceled NA NA — — Outstanding, December 31 52,243 $ 141.31 2,250 $ 152.19 7.7 $ 40,444 Exercisable, December 31 NA NA — — — — The total fair value of RSUs and PSUs that vested during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, was $2.5 billion, $3.2 billion and $2.9 billion, respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, was $24 million, $75 million and $232 million, respectively. Compensation expense The Firm recognized the following noncash compensation expense related to its various employee share-based incentive plans in its Consolidated statements of income. Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2023 2022 2021 Cost of prior grants of RSUs, PSUs and SARs that are amortized over their applicable vesting periods $ 1,510 $ 1,253 $ 1,161 Accrual of estimated costs of share- based awards to be granted in future periods, predominantly those to full- career eligible employees 1,607 1,541 1,768 Total noncash compensation expense related to employee share-based incentive plans $ 3,117 $ 2,794 $ 2,929 At December 31, 2023, approximately $1.0 billion (pretax) of compensation expense related to unvested awards had not yet been charged to net income. That cost is expected to be amortized into compensation expense over a weighted-average period of 1.7 years. The Firm does not capitalize any compensation expense related to share- based compensation awards to employees. Tax benefits Income tax benefits (including tax benefits from dividends or d ividend equivalents) related to share-based incentive arrangements recognized in the Firm’s Consolidated statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, were $836 million, $901 million and $957 million, respectively. Notes to consolidated financial statements 226 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K RSUs/PSUs SARsSARsSARs Note 10 – Investment securities Investment securities consist of debt securities that are classified as AFS or HTM. Debt securities classified as trading assets are discussed in Note 2. Predominantly all of the Firm’s AFS and HTM securities are held by Treasury and CIO in connection with its asset-liability management activities. AFS securities are carried at fair value on the Consolidated balance sheets. Unrealized gains and losses, after any applicable hedge accounting adjustments or allowance for credit losses, are reported in AOCI. The specific identification method is used to determine realized gains and losses on AFS securities, which are included in investment securities gains/(losses) on the Consolidated statements of income. HTM securities, which the Firm has the intent and ability to hold until maturity, are carried at amortized cost, net of allowance for credit losses, on the Consolidated balance sheets. For both AFS and HTM securities, purchase discounts or premiums are generally amortized into interest income on a level-yield basis over the contractual life of the security. However, premiums on certain callable debt securities are amortized to the earliest call date. Effective January 1, 2023, the Firm adopted the portfolio layer method hedge accounting guidance which permitted a transfer of HTM securities to AFS upon adoption. The Firm transferred obligations of U.S. states and municipalities with a carrying value of $7.1 billion resulting in the recognition of $38 million net pre-tax unrealized losses in AOCI. Refer to Note 1 and Note 24 for additional information. During 2022, the Firm transferred investment securities with a fair value of $78.3 billion from AFS to HTM for capital management purposes. AOCI included pretax unrealized losses of $4.8 billion on the securities at the date of transfer. Unrealized gains or losses at the date of transfer of these securities continue to be reported in AOCI and are amortized into interest income on a level-yield basis over the remaining life of the securities. This amortization will offset the effect on interest income of the amortization of the premium or discount resulting from the transfer recorded at fair value. Transfers of securities between AFS and HTM are non-cash transactions. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K 227 The amortized costs and estimated fair values of the investment securities portfolio were as follows for the dates indicated. 2023 2022 December 31, (in millions) Amortized cost(c)(d) Gross unrealized gains Gross unrealized losses Fair value Amortized cost(c)(d) Gross unrealized gains Gross unrealized losses Fair value Available-for-sale securities Mortgage-backed securities: U.S. GSEs and government agencies $ 88,377 $ 870 $ 4,077 $ 85,170 $ 77,194 $ 479 $ 6,170 $ 71,503 Residential: U.S. 2,086 10 68 2,028 1,576 1 111 1,466 Non-U.S. 1,608 4 1 1,611 3,176 5 27 3,154 Commercial 2,930 12 139 2,803 2,113 — 155 1,958 Total mortgage-backed securities 95,001 896 4,285 91,612 84,059 485 6,463 78,081 U.S. Treasury and government agencies 58,051 276 522 57,805 95,217 302 3,459 92,060 Obligations of U.S. states and municipalities 21,243 390 266 21,367 7,103 86 403 6,786 Non-U.S. government debt securities 21,387 254 359 21,282 20,360 14 678 19,696 Corporate debt securities 128 — 28 100 381 — 24 357 Asset-backed securities: Collateralized loan obligations 6,769 11 28 6,752 5,916 1 125 5,792 Other 2,804 8 26 2,786 3,152 2 69 3,085 Unallocated portfolio layer fair value basis adjustments(a) 73 (73) — NA NA NA NA NA Total available-for-sale securities 205,456 1,762 5,514 201,704 (e) 216,188 890 11,221 205,857 Held-to-maturity securities(b) Mortgage-backed securities: U.S. GSEs and government agencies 105,614 39 11,643 94,010 113,492 35 13,709 99,818 U.S. Residential 9,709 4 970 8,743 10,503 3 1,244 9,262 Commercial 10,534 13 581 9,966 10,361 10 734 9,637 Total mortgage-backed securities 125,857 56 13,194 112,719 134,356 48 15,687 118,717 U.S. Treasury and government agencies 173,666 — 13,074 160,592 207,463 — 18,363 189,100 Obligations of U.S. states and municipalities 9,945 74 591 9,428 19,747 53 1,080 18,720 Asset-backed securities: Collateralized loan obligations 58,565 47 352 58,260 61,414 4 1,522 59,896 Other 1,815 1 61 1,755 2,325 — 110 2,215 Total held-to-maturity securities 369,848 178 27,272 342,754 425,305 105 36,762 388,648 Total investment securities, net of allowance for credit losses $ 575,304 $ 1,940 $ 32,786 $ 544,458 $ 641,493 $ 995 $ 47,983 $ 594,505 (a) Represents the amount of portfolio layer method basis adjustments related to AFS securities hedged in a closed portfolio. Under U.S. GAAP portfolio layer method basis adjustments are not allocated to individual securities, however the amounts impact the unrealized gains or losses in the table for the types of securities being hedged. Refer to Note 1 and Note 5 for additional information. (b) The Firm purchased $4.1 billion, $33.7 billion and $111.8 billion of HTM securities for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respect ively. (c) The amortized cost of investment securities is reported net of allowance for credit losses of $128 million and $96 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. (d) Excludes $2.8 billion and $2.5 billion of accrued interest receivable at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, included in accrued interest and accounts receivable on the Consolidated balance sheets. The Firm generally does not recognize an allowance for credit losses on accrued interest receivable, consistent with its policy to write them off no later than 90 days past due by reversing interest income. The Firm did not reverse through interest income any accrued interest receivable for the years ended De cember 31, 2023 and 2022. (e) As of December 31, 2023, included $24.2 billion of AFS securities associated with First Republic. Refer to Note 34 for additional information. At December 31, 2023, the investment securities portfolio consisted of debt securities with an average credit rating of AA+ (based upon external ratings where available, and where not available, based primarily upon internal risk ratings). Risk ratings are used to identify the credit quality of securities and differentiate risk within the portfolio. The Firm’s internal risk ratings generally align with the qualitative characteristics (e.g., borrower capacity to meet financial commitments and vulnerability to changes in the economic environment) defined by S&P and Moody’s, however the quantitative characteristics (e.g., probability of default (“PD”) and loss given default (“LGD”)) may differ as they reflect internal historical experiences and assumptions. Risk ratings are assigned at acquisition, reviewed on a regular and ongoing basis by Credit Risk Management and adjusted as necessary over the life of the investment for updated information affecting the issuer’s ability to fulfill its obligations. Notes to consolidated financial statements 228 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K 2023 20222023 20222023 2022 AFS securities impairment The following tables present the fair value and gross unrealized losses by aging category for AFS securities at December 31, 2023 and 2022. The tables exclude U.S. Treasury and government agency securities and U.S. GSE and government agency MBS with unrealized losses of $4.6 billion and $9.6 billion, at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively; changes in the value of these securities are generally driven by changes in interest rates rather than changes in their credit profile given the explicit or implicit guarantees provided by the U.S. government.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K 229 Available-for-sale securities with gross unrealized losses Available-for-sale securities with gross unrealized losses Available-for-sale securities with gross unrealized losses Available-for-sale securities with gross unrealized losses Available-for-sale securities with gross unrealized losses Available-for-sale securities with gross unrealized losses Available-for-sale securities with gross unrealized losses Available-for-sale securities with gross unrealized losses Available-for-sale securities with gross unrealized losses Available-for-sale securities with gross unrealized losses Less than 12 months 12 months or more Less than 12 months 12 months or more AFS securities are considered impaired if the fair value is less than the amortized cost. The Firm recognizes impairment losses in earnings if the Firm has the intent to sell the debt security, or if it is more likely than not that the Firm will be required to sell the debt security before recovery of its amortized cost. In these circumstances the impairment loss is recognized in investment securities gains/(losses) in the Consolidated Statements of Income and is equal to the full difference between the amortized cost (net of allowance if applicable) and the fair value of the security. For impaired debt securities that the Firm has the intent and ability to hold, the securities are evaluated to determine if a credit loss exists. If it is determined that a credit loss exists, that loss is recognized as an allowance for credit losses through the provision for credit losses in the Consolidated Statements of Income, limited by the amount of impairment. Any impairment on debt securities that the Firm has the intent and ability to hold not due to credit losses is recorded in OCI. Factors considered in evaluating credit losses include adverse conditions specifically related to the industry, geographic area or financial condition of the issuer or underlying collateral of a security; and payment structure of the security. When assessing securities issued in a securitization for credit losses, the Firm estimates cash flows considering relevant market and economic data, underlying loan-level data, and structural features of the securitization, such as subordination, excess spread, overcollateralization or other forms of credit enhancement, and compares the losses projected for the underlying collateral (“pool losses”) against the level of credit enhancement in the securitization structure to determine whether these features are sufficient to absorb the pool losses, or whether a credit loss exists. For beneficial interests in securitizations that are rated below “AA” at their acquisition, or that can be contractually prepaid or otherwise settled in such a way that the Firm would not recover substantially all of its recorded investment, the Firm evaluates impairment for credit losses when there is an adverse change in expected cash flows. HTM securities – credit risk Allowance for credit losses The allowance for credit losses on HTM securities represents expected credit losses over the remaining expected life of the securities. The allowance for credit losses on HTM obligations of U.S. states and municipalities and commercial mortgage-backed securities is calculated by applying statistical credit loss factors (estimated PD and LGD) to the amortized cost. The credit loss factors are derived using a weighted average of five internally developed eight-quarter macroeconomic scenarios, followed by a single year straight-line interpolation to revert to long run historical information for periods beyond the forecast period. Refer to Note 13 for further information on the eight-quarter macroeconomic forecast. The allowance for credit losses on HTM collateralized loan obligations and U.S. residential mortgage-backed securities is calculated as the difference between the amortized cost and the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected, discounted at the security’s effective interest rate. These cash flow estimates are developed based on expectations of underlying collateral performance derived using the eight-quarter macroeconomic forecast and the single year straight-line interpolation, as well as considering the structural features of the security. The application of different inputs and assumptions into the calculation of the allowance for credit losses is subject to significant management judgment, and emphasizing one input or assumption over another, or considering other inputs or assumptions, could affect the estimate of the allowance for credit losses on HTM securities. Credit quality indicator The primary credit quality indicator for HTM securities is the risk rating assigned to each security. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, all HTM securities were rated investment grade and were current and accruing, with approximately 99% and 98% rated at least AA+, respectively. Allowance for credit losses on investment securities The allowance for credit losses on investment securities was $128 million, $96 million and $42 million as of December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, which included a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings related to the transfer of HTM securities to AFS for the year ended December 31, 2023.

The effective yield considers the contractual coupon, amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, and the effect of related hedging derivatives, including closed portfolio hedges. Taxable-equivalent amounts are used where applicable. The effective yield excludes unscheduled principal prepayments; and accordingly, actual maturities of securities may differ from their contractual or expected maturities as certain securities may be prepaid. However, for certain callable debt securities, the average yield is calculated to the earliest call date. (b) For purposes of this table, the amortized cost of available-for-sale securities excludes the allowance for credit losses of $34 million and the portfolio layer fair value hedge basis adjustments of $73 million at December 31, 2023. The amortized cost of held-to-maturity securities also excludes the allowance for credit losses of $94 million at December 31, 2023. (c) Substantially all of the Firm’s U.S. residential MBS and collateralized mortgage obligations are due in 10 years or more, based on contractual maturity. The estimated weighted-average life, which reflects anticipated future prepayments, is approximately seven years for agency residential MBS, seven years for agency residential collateralized mortgage obligations, and six years for nonagency residential collateralized mortgage obligations. (d) Includes AFS securities associated with First Republic, primarily due after 10 years. Refer to Note 34 for additional information. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K 231 Note 11 – Securities financing activities JPMorgan Chase enters into resale, repurchase, securities borrowed and securities loaned agreements (collectively, “securities financing agreements”) primarily to finance the Firm’s inventory positions, acquire securities to cover short sales, accommodate customers’ financing needs, settle other securities obligations and to deploy the Firm’s excess cash. Securities financing agreements are treated as collateralized financings on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets. Where appropriate under applicable accounting guidance, securities financing agreements with the same counterparty are reported on a net basis. Refer to Note 1 for further discussion of the offsetting of assets and liabilities. Fees received and paid in connection with securities financing agreements are recorded over the life of the agreement in interest income and interest expense on the Consolidated statements of income. The Firm has elected the fair value option for certain securities financing agreements. Refer to Note 3 for further information regarding the fair value option. The securities financing agreements for which the fair value option has been elected are reported within securities purchased under resale agreements, securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements, and securities borrowed on the Consolidated balance sheets. Generally, for agreements carried at fair value, current-period interest accruals are recorded within interest income and interest expense, with changes in fair value reported in principal transactions revenue. However, for financial instruments containing embedded derivatives that would be separately accounted for in accordance with accounting guidance for hybrid instruments, all changes in fair value, including any interest elements, are reported in principal transactions revenue. Securities financing agreements not elected under the fair value option are measured at amortized cost. As a result of the Firm’s credit risk mitigation practices described below, the Firm did not hold any allowance for credit losses with respect to resale and securities borrowed arrangements as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. Credit risk mitigation practices Securities financing agreements expose the Firm primarily to credit and liquidity risk. To manage these risks, the Firm monitors the value of the underlying securities (predominantly high-quality securities collateral, including government-issued debt and U.S. GSEs and government agencies MBS) that it has received from or provided to its counterparties compared to the value of cash proceeds and exchanged collateral, and either requests additional collateral or returns securities or collateral when appropriate. Margin levels are initially established based upon the counterparty, the type of underlying securities, and the permissible collateral, and are monitored on an ongoing basis. In resale and securities borrowed agreements, the Firm is exposed to credit risk to the extent that the value of the securities received is less than initial cash principal advanced and any collateral amounts exchanged. In repurchase and securities loaned agreements, credit risk exposure arises to the extent that the value of underlying securities advanced exceeds the value of the initial cash principal received, and any collateral amounts exchanged. Additionally, the Firm typically enters into master netting agreements and other similar arrangements with its counterparties, which provide for the right to liquidate the underlying securities and any collateral amounts exchanged in the event of a counterparty default. It is also the Firm’s policy to take possession, where possible, of the securities underlying resale and securities borrowed agreements. Refer to Note 29 for further information regarding assets pledged and collateral received in securities financing agreements. Notes to consolidated financial statements 232 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K The table below summarizes the gross and net amounts of the Firm’s securities financing agreements, as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. When the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to a master netting agreement with a counterparty and where other relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP are met, the Firm nets, on the Consolidated balance sheets, the balances outstanding under its securities financing agreements with the same counterparty. In addition, the Firm exchanges securities and/or cash collateral with its counterparty to reduce the economic exposure with the counterparty, but such collateral is not eligible for net Consolidated balance sheet presentation. Where the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the counterparty master netting agreement, such collateral, along with securities financing balances that do not meet all these relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP, is presented in the table below as “Amounts not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets,” and reduces the “Net amounts” presented. Where a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained, the securities financing balances are presented gross in the “Net amounts” below. In transactions where the Firm is acting as the lender in a securities-for-securities lending agreement and receives securities that can be pledged or sold as collateral, the Firm recognizes the securities received at fair value within other assets and the obligation to return those securities within accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets.

These transfers have been recognized as collateralized financing transactions. The transferred assets are recorded in trading assets and loans, and the corresponding liabilities are recorded primarily in short-term borrowings and long-term debt on the Consolidated balance sheets.

The Firm accounts for loans based on the following categories: • Originated or purchased loans held-for-investment (i.e., “retained”) • Loans held-for-sale • Loans at fair value The following provides a detailed accounting discussion of the Firm’s loans by category: Loans held-for-investment Originated or purchased loans held-for-investment, including PCD, are recorded at amortized cost, reflecting the principal amount outstanding, net of the following: unamortized deferred loan fees, costs, premiums or discounts; charge-offs; collection of cash; and foreign exchange. Credit card loans also include billed finance charges and fees. Interest income Interest income on performing loans held-for-investment is accrued and recognized as interest income at the contractual rate of interest. Purchase price discounts or premiums, as well as net deferred loan fees or costs, are recognized in interest income over the contractual life of the loan as an adjustment of yield. The Firm classifies accrued interest on loans, including accrued but unbilled interest on credit card loans, in accrued interest and accounts receivables on the Consolidated balance sheets. For credit card loans, accrued interest once billed is then recognized in the loan balances, with the related allowance recorded in the allowance for credit losses. Changes in the allowance for credit losses on accrued interest on credit card loans are recognized in the provision for credit losses and charge-offs are recognized by reversing interest income. For other loans, the Firm generally does not recognize an allowance for credit losses on accrued interest receivables, consistent with its policy to write them off no later than 90 days past due by reversing interest income. Nonaccrual loans Nonaccrual loans are those on which the accrual of interest has been suspended. Loans (other than credit card loans and certain consumer loans insured by U.S. government agencies) are placed on nonaccrual status and considered nonperforming when full payment of principal and interest is not expected, regardless of delinquency status, or when principal and interest has been in default for a period of 90 days or more, unless the loan is both well-secured and in the process of collection. A loan is determined to be past due when the minimum payment is not received from the borrower by the contractually specified due date or for certain loans (e.g., residential real estate loans), when a monthly payment is due and unpaid for 30 days or more. Finally, collateral-dependent loans are typically maintained on nonaccrual status. On the date a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, all interest accrued but not collected is reversed against interest income. In addition, the amortization of deferred amounts is suspended. Interest income on nonaccrual loans may be recognized as cash interest payments are received (i.e., on a cash basis) if the recorded loan balance is deemed fully collectible; however, if there is doubt regarding the ultimate collectibility of the recorded loan balance, all interest cash receipts are applied to reduce the carrying value of the loan (the cost recovery method). For consumer loans, application of this policy typically results in the Firm recognizing interest income on nonaccrual consumer loans on a cash basis. A loan may be returned to accrual status when repayment is reasonably assured and there has been demonstrated performance under the terms of the loan or, if applicable, the terms of the restructured loan. As permitted by regulatory guidance, credit card loans are generally exempt from being placed on nonaccrual status; accordingly, interest and fees related to credit card loans continue to accrue until the loan is charged off or paid in full. Allowance for loan losses The allowance for loan losses represents the estimated expected credit losses in the held-for-investment loan portfolio at the balance sheet date and is recognized on the balance sheet as a contra asset, which brings the amortized cost to the net carrying value. Changes in the allowance for loan losses are recorded in the provision for credit losses on the Firm’s Consolidated statements of income. Refer to Note 13 for further information on the Firm’s accounting policies for the allowance for loan losses. Charge-offs Consumer loans are generally charged off or charged down to the lower of the amortized cost or the net realizable value of the underlying collateral (i.e., fair value less estimated costs to sell), with an offset to the allowance for loan losses, upon reaching specified stages of delinquency in accordance with standards established by the FFIEC. Residential real estate loans, unmodified credit card loans and scored business banking loans are generally charged off no later than 180 days past due. Scored auto and closed-end consumer loans, including modified credit card accounts placed on a fixed payment plan, are charged off no later than 120 days past due. Certain consumer loans are charged off or charged down to their net realizable value earlier than the FFIEC charge-off standards in the following circumstances: • Loans modified to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty that are determined to be collateral- dependent. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K 235 • Loans to borrowers who have experienced an event that suggests a loss is either known or highly certain are subject to accelerated charge-off standards (e.g., residential real estate and auto loans are charged off or charged down within 60 days of receiving notification of a bankruptcy filing). • Auto loans upon repossession of the automobile. Other than in certain limited circumstances, the Firm typically does not recognize charge-offs on the government- guaranteed portion of loans. Wholesale loans are charged off when it is highly certain that a loss has been realized. The determination of whether to recognize a charge-off includes many factors, including the prioritization of the Firm’s claim in bankruptcy, expectations of the workout/restructuring of the loan and valuation of the borrower’s equity or the loan collateral. When a loan is charged down to the lower of its amortized cost or the estimated net realizable value of the underlying collateral, the determination of the fair value of the collateral depends on the type of collateral (e.g., securities, real estate). In cases where the collateral is in the form of liquid securities, the fair value is based on quoted market prices or broker quotes. For illiquid securities or other financial assets, the fair value of the collateral is generally estimated using a discounted cash flow model. For residential real estate loans, collateral values are based upon external valuation sources. When it becomes likely that a borrower is either unable or unwilling to pay, the Firm utilizes a broker’s price opinion, appraisal and/or an automated valuation model of the home based on an exterior-only valuation (“exterior opinions”), which is then updated at least every 12 months, or more frequently depending on various market factors. As soon as practicable after the Firm receives the property in satisfaction of a debt (e.g., by taking legal title or physical possession), the Firm generally obtains an appraisal based on an inspection that includes the interior of the home (“interior appraisals”). Exterior opinions and interior appraisals are discounted based upon the Firm’s experience with actual liquidation values as compared with the estimated values provided by exterior opinions and interior appraisals, considering state- specific factors. For commercial real estate loans, collateral values are generally based on appraisals from internal and external valuation sources. Collateral values are typically updated every six to twelve months, either by obtaining a new appraisal or by performing an internal analysis, in accordance with the Firm’s policies. The Firm also considers both borrower- and market-specific factors, which may result in obtaining appraisal updates or broker price opinions at more frequent intervals. Loans held-for-sale Loans held-for-sale are measured at the lower of cost or fair value, with valuation changes recorded in noninterest revenue. For consumer loans, the valuation is performed on a portfolio basis. For wholesale loans, the valuation is performed on an individual loan basis. Interest income on loans held-for-sale is accrued and recognized based on the contractual rate of interest. Loan origination fees or costs and purchase price discounts or premiums are deferred in a contra loan account until the related loan is sold. The deferred fees or costs and discounts or premiums are an adjustment to the basis of the loan and therefore are included in the periodic determination of the lower of cost or fair value adjustments and/or the gain or loss recognized at the time of sale. Because these loans are recognized at the lower of cost or fair value, the Firm’s allowance for loan losses and charge- off policies do not apply to these loans. However, loans held-for-sale are subject to the Firm’s nonaccrual policies. Loans at fair value Loans for which the fair value option has been elected are measured at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded in noninterest revenue. Interest income on these loans is accrued and recognized based on the contractual rate of interest. Changes in fair value are recognized in noninterest revenue. Loan origination fees are recognized upfront in noninterest revenue. Loan origination costs are recognized in the associated expense category as incurred. Because these loans are recognized at fair value, the Firm’s allowance for loan losses and charge-off policies do not apply to these loans. However, loans at fair value are subject to the Firm’s nonaccrual policies. Refer to Note 3 for further information on the Firm’s elections of fair value accounting under the fair value option. Refer to Note 2 and Note 3 for further information on loans carried at fair value and classified as trading assets. Notes to consolidated financial statements 236 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K Loan classification changes Loans in the held-for-investment portfolio that management decides to sell are transferred to the held-for- sale portfolio at the lower of cost or fair value on the date of transfer. Credit-related losses are charged against the allowance for loan losses; non-credit related losses such as those due to changes in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates are recognized in noninterest revenue. In the event that management decides to retain a loan in the held-for-sale portfolio, the loan is transferred to the held-for-investment portfolio at amortized cost on the date of transfer. These loans are subsequently assessed for impairment based on the Firm’s allowance methodology. Refer to Note 13 for a further discussion of the methodologies used in establishing the Firm’s allowance for loan losses. Loan modifications The Firm seeks to modify certain loans in conjunction with its loss mitigation activities. Through the modification, JPMorgan Chase grants one or more concessions to a borrower who is experiencing financial difficulty in order to minimize the Firm’s economic loss and avoid foreclosure or repossession of the collateral, and to ultimately maximize payments received by the Firm from the borrower. The concessions granted vary by program and by borrower- specific characteristics, and may include interest rate reductions, term extensions, other-than-insignificant payment delays or principal forgiveness. Effective January 1, 2023 the Firm adopted the Financial Instruments - Credit Losses: Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosure accounting guidance, which changed the accounting for loan modifications from TDRs to FDMs. Refer to Note 1 for further information. Loans, except for credit card loans, reported as FDMs are generally placed on nonaccrual status, although in many cases such loans were already on nonaccrual status prior to modification. These loans may be returned to performing status (the accrual of interest is resumed) if the following criteria are met: (i) the borrower has performed under the modified terms for a minimum of six months and/or six payments, and (ii) the Firm has an expectation that repayment of the modified loan is reasonably assured based on, for example, the borrower’s debt capacity and level of future earnings, collateral values, LTV ratios, and other current market considerations. In certain limited and well- defined circumstances in which the loan is current at the modification date, such loans are not placed on nonaccrual status at the time of modification. The allowance for credit losses associated with FDMs is measured using the Firm’s established allowance methodology, which considers the expected re-default rates for the modified loans. Refer to Note 13 for further discussion. For periods ending prior to January 1, 2023, modifications of loans where the Firm granted concessions to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty were accounted for and reported as TDRs. The concessions granted varied by program and by borrower-specific characteristics, and included interest rate reductions, term extensions, payment delays, principal forgiveness, or the acceptance of equity or other assets in lieu of payments. Loans with short-term and other insignificant modifications that were not considered concessions were not TDRs. Loans modified in TDRs were generally measured for impairment using the Firm’s established asset-specific allowance methodology, which considers the expected redefault rates for the modified loans. A loan modified in a TDR generally remained subject to the asset-specific component of the allowance throughout its remaining life, regardless of whether the loan was performing and had been returned to accrual status. Refer to Note 13 for further discussion. Foreclosed property The Firm acquires property from borrowers through loan restructurings, workouts, and foreclosures. Property acquired may include real property (e.g., residential real estate, land, and buildings) and other commercial and personal property (e.g., automobiles, aircraft, railcars, and ships). The Firm recognizes foreclosed property upon receiving assets in satisfaction of a loan (e.g., by taking legal title or physical possession). For loans collateralized by real property, the Firm generally recognizes the asset received at foreclosure sale or upon the execution of a deed in lieu of foreclosure transaction with the borrower. Foreclosed assets are reported in other assets on the Consolidated balance sheets and initially recognized at fair value less estimated costs to sell. Each quarter the fair value of the acquired property is reviewed and adjusted, if necessary, to the lower of cost or fair value. Subsequent adjustments to fair value are charged/credited to noninterest revenue. Operating expense, such as real estate taxes and maintenance, are charged to other expense. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K 237 Loan portfolio The Firm’s loan portfolio is divided into three portfolio segments, which are the same segments used by the Firm to determine the allowance for loan losses: Consumer, excluding credit card; Credit card; and Wholesale. Within each portfolio segment the Firm monitors and assesses the credit risk in the following classes of loans, based on the risk characteristics of each loan class. Consumer, excluding credit card Credit card Wholesale(c)(d) • Residential real estate(a) • Auto and other(b) • Credit card loans • Secured by real estate • Commercial and industrial • Other(e) (a) Includes scored mortgage and home equity loans held in CCB and AWM, and scored mortgage loans held in CIB. (b) Includes scored auto, business banking and consumer unsecured loans as well as overdrafts, primarily in CCB. (c) Includes loans held in CIB, CB, AWM, Corporate, and risk-rated exposure held in CCB, for which the wholesale methodology is applied when determining the allowance for loan losses. (d) The wholesale portfolio segment's classes align with loan classifications as defined by the bank regulatory agencies, based on the loan's collateral, purpose, and type of borrower. (e) Includes loans to SPEs, financial institutions, personal investment companies and trusts, individuals and individual entities (predominantly Global Private Bank clients within AWM and J.P. Morgan Wealth Management within CCB), states and political subdivisions, as well as loans to nonprofits. Refer to Note 14 for more information on SPEs.

The Firm typically elects t o repurchase these delinquent loans as it continues to service them and/or manage the foreclosure process in accordance with applicable requirements of Ginnie Mae, FHA, RHS, and/or VA. (c) Excludes purchases of retained loans of $5.1 billion, $12.4 billion and $25.8 billion for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respect ively, which are predominantly sourced through the correspondent origination channel and underwritten in accordance with the Firm’s standards. (d) Includes loans acquired in the First Republic acquisition consisting of $91.9 billion in Consumer, excluding credit card and $59.2 billion in Wholesale. Refer to Note 34 for additional information. Gains and losses on sales of loans Net gains/(losses) on sales of loans and lending-related commitments (including adjustments to record loans and lending- related commitments held-for-sale at the lower of cost or fair value) recognized in noninterest revenue was $56 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 of which $62 million was related to loans. Net gains/(losses) on sales of loans and lending- related commitments was $(186) million for the year ended December 31, 2022 of which $(48) million was related to loans. Net gains/(losses) on sales of loans and lending-related commitments was $261 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 of which $253 million was related to loans. In addition, the sale of loans may also result in write downs, recoveries or changes in the allowance recognized in the provision for credit losses. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K 239 202120212021 Consumer, excluding credit card loan portfolio Consumer loans, excluding credit card loans, consist primarily of scored residential mortgages, home equity loans and lines of credit, auto and business banking loans, with a focus on serving the prime consumer credit market. These loans include home equity loans secured by junior liens, prime mortgage loans with an interest-only payment period, and certain payment-option loans that may result in negative amortization. The following table provides information about retained consumer loans, excluding credit card, by class. December 31, (in millions) 2023 2022 Residential real estate $ 326,409 (a) $ 237,561 Auto and other 70,866 63,192 Total retained loans $ 397,275 $ 300,753 (a) Included $90.7 billion of loans associated with First Republic. Delinquency rates are the primary credit quality indicator for consumer loans. Loans that are more than 30 days past due provide an early warning of borrowers who may be experiencing financial difficulties and/or who may be unable or unwilling to repay the loan. As the loan continues to age, it becomes more clear whether the borrower is likely to be unable or unwilling to pay. In the case of residential real estate loans, late-stage delinquencies (greater than 150 days past due) are a strong indicator of loans that will ultimately result in a foreclosure or similar liquidation transaction. In addition to delinquency rates, other credit quality indicators for consumer loans vary based on the class of loan, as follows: • For residential real estate loans, the current estimated LTV ratio, or the combined LTV ratio in the case of junior lien loans, is an indicator of the potential loss severity in the event of default. Additionally, LTV or combined LTV ratios can provide insight into a borrower’s continued willingness to pay, as the delinquency rate of high-LTV loans tends to be greater than that for loans where the borrower has equity in the collateral. The geographic distribution of the loan collateral also provides insight as to the credit quality of the portfolio, as factors such as the regional economy, home price changes and specific events such as natural disasters, will affect credit quality. The borrower’s current or “refreshed” FICO score is a secondary credit quality indicator for certain loans, as FICO scores are an indication of the borrower’s credit payment history. Thus, a loan to a borrower with a low FICO score (less than 660) is considered to be of higher risk than a loan to a borrower with a higher FICO score. Further, a loan to a borrower with a high LTV ratio and a low FICO score is at greater risk of default than a loan to a borrower that has both a high LTV ratio and a high FICO score. • For scored auto and business banking loans, geographic distribution is an indicator of the credit performance of the portfolio. Similar to residential real estate loans, geographic distribution provides insights into the portfolio performance based on regional economic activity and events. Notes to consolidated financial statements 240 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K Residential real estate Delinquency is the primary credit quality indicator for retained residential real estate loans.

(c) Included $6.4 billion, $26.3 billion, $21.9 billion, $14.8 billion, $7.4 billion, and $10.9 billion of term loans originated in 2023, 2022, 2021, 2020, 2019 and prior to 2019, respectively, and $2.5 billion of revolving loans within the revolving period associated with First Republic. (d) Excludes mortgage loans that are 30 or more days past due insured by U.S. government agencies which were not material at December 31, 2023 and 2022. These amounts have been excluded based upon the government guarantee. (e) Included $343 million of 30 or more days past due loans associated with First Republic. (f) Purchased loans are included in the year in which they were originated. Approximately 37% of the total revolving loans are senior lien loans; the remaining balance are junior lien loans. The lien position the Firm holds is considered in the Firm’s allowance for credit losses. Revolving loans that have been converted to term loans have higher delinquency rates than those that are still within the revolving period. That is primarily because the fully-amortizing payment that is generally required for those products is higher than the minimum payment options available for revolving loans within the revolving period.

The Firm reports, in accordance with regulatory guidance, residential real estate loans that have been discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not reaffirmed by the borrower (“Chapter 7 loans”) as collateral-dependent nonaccrual loans, regardless of their delinquency status. At December 31, 2023, approximately 9% of Chapter 7 residential real estate loans were 30 days or more past due. (b) Mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies excluded from nonaccrual loans were not material at December 31, 2023 and 2022. (c) Generally, all consumer nonaccrual loans have an allowance. In accordance with regulatory guidance, certain nonaccrual loans that are considered collateral-dependent have been charged down to the lower of amortized cost or the fair value of their underlying collateral less costs to sell. If the value of the underlying collateral improves subsequent to charge down, the related allowance may be negative. (d) Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis was $180 million and $175 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. (e) Generally excludes loans under payment deferral programs offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. (f) Represents the aggregate unpaid principal balance of loans divided by the estimated current property value. Current property values are estimated, at a minimum, quarterly, based on home valuation models using nationally recognized home price index valuation estimates incorporating actual data to the extent available and forecasted data where actual data is not available. Current estimated combined LTV for junior lien home equity loans considers all available lien positions, as well as unused lines, related to the property. (g) Refreshed FICO scores represent each borrower’s most recent credit score, which is obtained by the Firm on at least a quarterly basis. (h) Includes residential real estate loans, primarily held in LLCs in AWM that did not have a refreshed FICO score. These loans have been included in a FICO band based on management’s estimation of the borrower’s credit quality. (i) Included U.S. government-guaranteed loans as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. (j) Excludes loans with no FICO and/or LTV data available.

(l) Included $1.1 billion in equal to or greater than 660 FICO scores within 80% to 100% LTV ratio, and $87.9 billion and $1.1 billion in equal to or greater than 660 and less than 660 FICO scores, respectively, within less than 80% LTV ratio associated with First Republic. (m) Included $90.7 billion of loans associated with First Republic. (n) Included $54.9 billion, $14.9 billion, $3.5 billion, and $7.8 billion in California, New York, Florida and Massachusetts, respectively, associated with First Republic. Notes to consolidated financial statements 242 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K Loan modifications The Firm grants certain modifications of residential real estate loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, which effective January 1, 2023, are reported as FDMs. The Firm's proprietary modification programs as well as government programs, including U.S. GSE programs, that generally provide various modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty including, but not limited to, interest rate reductions, term extensions, other-than- insignificant payment delay and principal forgiveness that would otherwise have been required under the terms of the original agreement, are considered FDMs. Financial effects of FDMs For the year ended December 31, 2023, residential real estate FDMs were $136 million. The financial effects of the FDMs, which were predominantly in the form of term extensions and interest rate reductions, included extending the weighted-average life of the loans by 20 years, and reducing the weighted-average contractual interest rate from 7.21% to 4.44% for the year ended December 31, 2023. There were no additional commitments to lend to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty whose loans have been modified as FDMs. In addition to FDMs, the Firm also had $69 million of loans subject to a trial modification, and $9 million of Chapter 7 loans for the year ended December 31, 2023. The changes to the TDR accounting guidance eliminated the TDR reasonably expected and concession assessment criteria. Accordingly, trial modifications and Chapter 7 loans were considered TDRs, but not FDMs. Refer to Note 1 for further information. Payment status of FDMs and redefaults For the year ended December 31, 2023, residential real estate FDMs of $29 million were 30 or more days past due and FDMs that re-defaulted were $17 million. Nature and extent of TDRs For periods ending prior to January 1, 2023, modifications of residential real estate loans where the Firm granted concessions to borrowers who were experiencing financial difficulty were generally accounted for and reported as TDRs. Loans with short-term or other insignificant modifications that were not considered concessions were not TDRs. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, new TDRs were $362 million and $866 million, and there were no additional commitments to lend to borrowers whose residential real estate loans were modified in TDRs. The Firm’s proprietary modification programs as well as government programs, including U.S. GSE programs, generally provide various concessions to financially troubled borrowers including, but not limited to, interest rate reductions, term or payment extensions and delays of principal and/or interest payments that would otherwise have been required under the terms of the original agreement. The following table provides information about how residential real estate loans were modified in TDRs during the period presented. This table excludes loans with short- term or other insignificant modifications that are not considered concessions. Year ended December 31, 2022 2021 Number of loans approved for a trial modification 3,902 6,246 Number of loans permanently modified 4,182 4,588 Concession granted:(a) Interest rate reduction 54 % 74 % Term or payment extension 67 53 Principal and/or interest deferred 10 23 Principal forgiveness 1 2 Other(b) 37 36 (a) Represents concessions granted in permanent modifications as a percentage of the number of loans permanently modified. The sum of the percentages exceeds 100% because predominantly all of the modifications include more than one type of concession. Concessions offered on trial modifications are generally consistent with those granted on permanent modifications. (b) Includes variable interest rate to fixed interest rate modifications and payment delays that meet the definition of a TDR. Financial effects of TDRs and redefaults The following table provides information about the financial effects of the various concessions granted in modifications of residential real estate loans and about redefaults of certain loans modified in TDRs for the periods presented.

Typically the principal balance of the loans is insured and interest is guaranteed at a specified reimbursement rate subject to meeting the guidelines set by the SBA. There were no loans that were not guaranteed by the SBA that are 90 or more days past due and still accruing interest at De cember 31, 2023 and 2022. (b) Generally, all consumer nonaccrual loans have an allowance. In accordance with regulatory guidance, certain nonaccrual loans that are considered collateral-dependent have been charged down to the lower of amortized cost or the fair value of their underlying collateral less costs to sell. If the value of the underlying collateral improves subsequent to charge down, the related allowance may be negative. (c) Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis was not material for the years ended De cember 31, 2023 and 2022. (d) The geographic regions presented in this table are ordered based on the magnitude of the corresponding loan balances at De cember 31, 2023. Loan modifications The Firm grants certain modifications of auto and other loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, which effective January 1, 2023, are reported as FDMs. For the year ended December 31, 2023, auto and other FDMs were not material and there were no additional commitments to lend to borrowers modified as FDMs. For periods ending prior to January 1, 2023, modifications of auto and other loans where the Firm granted concessions to borrowers who were experiencing financial difficulty were generally accounted for and reported as TDRs. Loans with short-term or other insignificant modifications that were not considered concessions were not TDRs. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, auto and other TDRs were not material. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K 245 Total Auto and other Credit card loan portfolio The credit card portfolio segment includes credit card loans originated and purchased by the Firm. Delinquency rates are the primary credit quality indicator for credit card loans as they provide an early warning that borrowers may be experiencing difficulties (30 days past due); information on those borrowers that have been delinquent for a longer period of time (90 days past due) is also considered. In addition to delinquency rates, the geographic distribution of the loans provides insight as to the credit quality of the portfolio based on the regional economy. While the borrower’s credit score is another general indicator of credit quality, the Firm does not view credit scores as a primary indicator of credit quality because the borrower’s credit score tends to be a lagging indicator. The distribution of such scores provides a general indicator of credit quality trends within the portfolio; however, the score does not capture all factors that would be predictive of future credit performance. Refreshed FICO score information, which is obtained at least quarterly, for a statistically significant random sample of the credit card portfolio is indicated in other credit quality indicators. FICO is considered to be the industry benchmark for credit scores. The Firm generally originates new credit card accounts to prime consumer borrowers. However, certain cardholders’ FICO scores may decrease over time, depending on the performance of the cardholder and changes in the credit score calculation.

Loan modifications The Firm grants certain modifications of credit card loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, which effective January 1, 2023, are reported as FDMs. These modifications may involve placing the customer’s credit card account on a fixed payment plan, generally for 60 months, which typically includes reducing the interest rate on the credit card account. If the borrower does not make the contractual payments when due under the modified payment terms, the credit card loan continues to age and will be charged-off in accordance with the Firm's standard charge-off policy. In most cases, the Firm does not reinstate the borrower's line of credit. Financial effects of FDMs The following table provides information on credit card loan modifications considered FDMs. Year ended December 31, 2023 (in millions) Amortized cost basis % of loan modifications to total retained credit card loans Financial effect of loan modification Loan modification Term extension and interest rate reduction(a)(b) $ 648 0.31 % Term extension with a reduction in the weighted average contractual interest rate from 23.19% to 3.64% Total $ 648 (a) Term extension includes credit card loans whose terms have been modified under long-term programs by placing the customer’s credit card account on a fixed payment plan. (b) The interest rates represent weighted average at enrollment. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Firm also had $27 million of credit card loans subject to trial modifications. The changes to the TDR accounting guidance eliminated the TDR reasonably expected and concession assessment criteria. Accordingly, trial modifications are not considered FDMs. Payment status of FDMs and redefaults The following table provides information on the payment status of FDMs during the year ended December 31, 2023. Year ended December 31, 2023 (in millions) Amortized cost basis Current and less than 30 days past due and still accruing $ 558 30-89 days past due and still accruing 59 90 or more days past due and still accruing 31 Total $ 648 There were $50 million FDMs that re-defaulted during the year ended December 31, 2023 which were a combination of term extension and interest rate reduction. For credit card loans modified as FDMs, payment default is deemed to have occurred when the borrower misses two consecutive contractual payments. Defaulted modified credit card loans remain in the modification program and continue to be charged off in accordance with the Firm's standard charge-off policy. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K 247 Financial effects of TDRs and redefaults For periods ending prior to January 1, 2023, modifications of credit card loans where the Firm granted concessions to borrowers who were experiencing financial difficulty were generally accounted for and reported as TDRs. The Firm granted concessions for most of the credit card loans under long-term programs. These concessions involved placing the customer’s credit card account on a fixed payment plan, generally for 60 months, and typically included reducing the interest rate on the credit card account. Substantially all modifications under the Firm’s long-term programs were considered to be TDRs. Loans with short-term or other insignificant modifications that were not considered concessions were not reported as TDRs. The following table provides information about the financial effects of the concessions granted on credit card loans modified in TDRs and redefaults for the periods presented. For all periods disclosed, new enrollments were less than 1% of total retained credit card loans. Year ended December 31, (in millions, except weighted-average data) 2022 2021 Balance of new TDRs(a) $ 418 $ 393 Weighted-average interest rate of loans – before TDR 19.86 % 17.75 % Weighted-average interest rate of loans – after TDR 4.13 5.14 Balance of loans that redefaulted within one year of modification(b) $ 34 $ 57 (a) Represents the outstanding balance prior to modification. (b) Represents loans modified in TDRs that experienced a payment default in the periods presented, and for which the payment default occurred within one year of the modification. The amounts presented represent the balance of such loans as of the end of the quarter in which they defaulted. For credit card loans modified in TDRs, payment default was deemed to have occurred when the borrower missed two consecutive contractual payments. Defaulted modified credit card loans remained in the modification program and continued to be charged of in accordance with the Firm’s standard charge-off policy. Notes to consolidated financial statements 248 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K Wholesale loan portfolio Wholesale loans include loans made to a variety of clients, ranging from large corporate and institutional clients to high-net-worth individuals. The primary credit quality indicator for wholesale loans is the internal risk rating assigned to each loan. Risk ratings are used to identify the credit quality of loans and differentiate risk within the portfolio. Risk ratings on loans consider the PD and the LGD. The PD is the likelihood that a loan will default. The LGD is the estimated loss on the loan that would be realized upon the default of the borrower and takes into consideration collateral and structural support for each credit facility. Management considers several factors to determine an appropriate internal risk rating, including the obligor’s debt capacity and financial flexibility, the level of the obligor’s earnings, the amount and sources for repayment, the level and nature of contingencies, management strength, and the industry and geography in which the obligor operates. The Firm’s internal risk ratings generally align with the qualitative characteristics (e.g., borrower capacity to meet financial commitments and vulnerability to changes in the economic environment) defined by S&P and Moody’s, however the quantitative characteristics (e.g., PD and LGD) may differ as they reflect internal historical experiences and assumptions. The Firm generally considers internal ratings with qualitative characteristics equivalent to BBB-/Baa3 or higher as investment grade, and these ratings have a lower PD and/or lower LGD than non-investment grade ratings. Noninvestment-grade ratings are further classified as noncriticized and criticized, and the criticized portion is further subdivided into performing and nonaccrual loans, representing management’s assessment of the collectibility of principal and interest. Criticized loans have a higher PD than noncriticized loans. The Firm’s definition of criticized aligns with the U.S. banking regulatory definition of criticized exposures, which consist of special mention, substandard and doubtful categories. Refer to Note 1 for additional information. Risk ratings are reviewed on a regular and ongoing basis by Credit Risk Management and are adjusted as necessary for updated information affecting the obligor’s ability to fulfill its obligations. As noted above, the risk rating of a loan considers the industry in which the obligor conducts its operations. As part of the overall credit risk management framework, the Firm focuses on the management and diversification of its industry and client exposures, with particular attention paid to industries with an actual or potential credit concern. Refer to Note 4 for further detail on industry concentrations. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K 249 Internal risk rating is the primary credit quality indicator for retained wholesale loans.

As of December 31, 2023, additional unfunded commitments to lend to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty for Commercial and industrial and Other loan FDMs were $1.8 billion and $4 million, respectively. There were no additional unfunded commitments to lend to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties for Secured by real estate loan FDMs. Nature and extent of TDRs Prior to January 1, 2023, certain loan modifications were considered TDRs. These loan modifications provided various concessions to borrower who were experiencing financial difficulty. Loans with short-term or other insignificant modifications that were not considered concessions were not TDRs nor were loans for which the Firm elected to suspend TDR accounting guidance under the option provided by the CARES Act. For the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, new TDRs were $801 million and $881 million, respectively. New TDRs for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 reflected extended maturity dates and covenant waivers primarily in the Commercial and Industrial loan class. For the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the impact of these modifications resulting in new TDRs was not material to the Firm. As a result of the elimination of the requirement to assess whether a modification is reasonably expected or involves a concession, the population of loans considered FDMs is greater than the population previously considered TDRs.

The allowance for credit losses generally comprises: • the allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated), • the allowance for lending-related commitments, which is presented on the Consolidated balance sheets in accounts payable and other liabilities, and • the allowance for credit losses on investment securities, which is reflected in investment securities on the Consolidated balance sheets. The income statement effect of all changes in the allowance for credit losses is recognized in the provision for credit losses. Determining the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses is complex and requires significant judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. At least quarterly, the allowance for credit losses is reviewed by the CRO, the CFO and the Controller of the Firm. Subsequent evaluations of credit exposures, considering the macroeconomic conditions, forecasts and other factors then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the allowance for credit losses in future periods. The Firm’s policies used to determine its allowance for loan losses and its allowance for lending-related commitments are described in the following paragraphs. Refer to Note 10 for a description of the policies used to determine the allowance for credit losses on investment securities. Methodology for allowances for loan losses and lending- related commitments The allowance for loan losses and allowance for lending- related commitments represents expected credit losses over the remaining expected life of retained loans and lending-related commitments that are not unconditionally cancellable. The Firm does not record an allowance for future draws on unconditionally cancellable lending-related commitments (e.g., credit cards). Expected losses related to accrued interest on credit card loans are considered in the Firm’s allowance for loan losses. However, the Firm does not record an allowance on other accrued interest receivables, due to its policy to write these receivables off no later than 90 days past due by reversing interest income. The expected life of each instrument is determined by considering its contractual term, expected prepayments, cancellation features, and certain extension and call options. The expected life of funded credit card loans is generally estimated by considering expected future payments on the credit card account, and determining how much of those amounts should be allocated to repayments of the funded loan balance (as of the balance sheet date) versus other account activity. This allocation is made using an approach that incorporates the payment application requirements of the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009, generally paying down the highest interest rate balances first. The estimate of expected credit losses includes expected recoveries of amounts previously charged off or expected to be charged off, even if such recoveries result in a negative allowance. Collective and Individual Assessments When calculating the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for lending-related commitments, the Firm assesses whether exposures share similar risk characteristics. If similar risk characteristics exist, the Firm estimates expected credit losses collectively, considering the risk associated with a particular pool and the probability that the exposures within the pool will deteriorate or default. The assessment of risk characteristics is subject to significant management judgment. Emphasizing one characteristic over another or considering additional characteristics could affect the allowance. • Relevant risk characteristics for the consumer portfolio include product type, delinquency status, current FICO scores, geographic distribution, and, for collateralized loans, current LTV ratios. • Relevant risk characteristics for the wholesale portfolio include risk rating, delinquency status, tenor, level and type of collateral, LOB, geography, industry, credit enhancement, product type, facility purpose, and payment terms. The majority of the Firm’s credit exposures share risk characteristics with other similar exposures, and as a result are collectively assessed for impairment (“portfolio-based component”). The portfolio-based component covers consumer loans, performing risk-rated loans and certain lending-related commitments. If an exposure does not share risk characteristics with other exposures, the Firm generally estimates expected credit losses on an individual basis, considering expected repayment and conditions impacting that individual exposure (“asset-specific component”). The asset-specific component covers collateral-dependent loans and risk- rated loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status. Portfolio-based component The portfolio-based component begins with a quantitative calculation that considers the likelihood of the borrower changing delinquency status or moving from one risk rating to another. The quantitative calculation covers expected credit losses over an instrument’s expected life and is estimated by applying credit loss factors to the Firm’s estimated exposure at default. The credit loss factors incorporate the probability of borrower default as well as loss severity in the event of default. They are derived using a weighted average of five internally developed macroeconomic scenarios over an eight-quarter forecast period, followed by a single year straight-line interpolation JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K 255 to revert to long run historical information for periods beyond the eight-quarter forecast period. The five macroeconomic scenarios consist of a central, relative adverse, extreme adverse, relative upside and extreme upside scenario, and are updated by the Firm’s central forecasting team. The scenarios take into consideration the Firm’s macroeconomic outlook, internal perspectives from subject matter experts across the Firm, and market consensus and involve a governed process that incorporates feedback from senior management across LOBs, Corporate Finance and Risk Management. The quantitative calculation is adjusted to take into consideration model imprecision, emerging risk assessments, trends and other subjective factors that are not yet reflected in the calculation. These adjustments are accomplished in part by analyzing the historical loss experience, including during stressed periods, for each major product or model. Management applies judgment in making this adjustment, including taking into account uncertainties associated with the economic and political conditions, quality of underwriting standards, borrower behavior, credit concentrations or deterioration within an industry, product or portfolio, as well as other relevant internal and external factors affecting the credit quality of the portfolio. In certain instances, the interrelationships between these factors create further uncertainties. The application of different inputs into the quantitative calculation, and the assumptions used by management to adjust the quantitative calculation, are subject to significant management judgment, and emphasizing one input or assumption over another, or considering other inputs or assumptions, could affect the estimate of the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for lending-related commitments. Asset-specific component To determine the asset-specific component of the allowance, collateral-dependent loans (including those loans for which foreclosure is probable) and nonaccrual risk-rated loans in the wholesale portfolio segment are generally evaluated individually. On January 1, 2023 the Firm adopted the Financial Instruments - Credit Losses: Troubled Debt Restructurings accounting guidance as described in Note 1. The adoption of this guidance eliminated the requirement to measure the allowance for TDRs using a discounted cash flow (DCF) methodology and allowed the option of a non- DCF portfolio-based approach for modified loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. If a DCF methodology is still applied for these modified loans, the discount rate must be the post-modification effective interest rate, instead of the pre-modification effective interest rate. The Firm elected to change from an asset-specific allowance approach to its non-DCF, portfolio-based allowance approach for modified loans to troubled borrowers for all portfolios except collateral-dependent loans and nonaccrual risk-rated loans, for which the asset-specific allowance approach will continue to apply. The adoption did not impact the collateral-dependent allowance approach or scope. This guidance was adopted under the modified retrospective method which resulted in a net decrease to the allowance for credit losses of $587 million and an increase to retained earnings of $446 million, after-tax predominantly driven by residential real estate and credit card. For collateral-dependent loans, the fair value of collateral less estimated costs to sell, as applicable, is used to determine the charge-off amount for declines in value (to reduce the amortized cost of the loan to the fair value of collateral) or the amount of negative allowance that should be recognized (for recoveries of prior charge-offs associated with improvements in the fair value of the collateral). For non-collateral dependent loans, the Firm generally measures the asset-specific allowance as the difference between the amortized cost of the loan and the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected, discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate. Subsequent changes in impairment are generally recognized as an adjustment to the allowance for loan losses. The asset-specific component of the allowance for non-collateral dependent loans incorporates the effect of the modification on the loan’s expected cash flows including changes in interest rates, principal forgiveness, and other concessions, as well as management’s expectation of the borrower’s ability to repay under the modified terms. Estimating the timing and amounts of future cash flows is highly judgmental as these cash flow projections rely upon estimates such as loss severities, asset valuations, the amounts and timing of interest or principal payments (including any expected prepayments) or other factors that are reflective of current and expected market conditions. These estimates are, in turn, dependent on factors such as the duration of current overall economic conditions, industry, portfolio, or borrower-specific factors, the expected outcome of insolvency proceedings as well as, in certain circumstances, other economic factors. All of these estimates and assumptions require significant management judgment and certain assumptions are highly subjective. Other financial assets In addition to loans and investment securities, the Firm holds other financial assets that are measured at amortized cost on the Consolidated balance sheets, including credit exposures arising from lending activities subject to collateral maintenance requirements. Management estimates the allowance for other financial assets using various techniques considering historical losses and current economic conditions. Credit risk arising from lending activities subject to collateral maintenance requirements is generally mitigated by factors such as the short-term nature of the activity, the Notes to consolidated financial statements 256 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K fair value of collateral held and the Firm’s right to call for, and the borrower’s obligation to provide additional margin when the fair value of the collateral declines. Because of these mitigating factors, these exposures generally do not require an allowance for credit losses. However, management may also consider other factors such as the borrower’s ongoing ability to provide collateral to satisfy margin requirements, or whether collateral is significantly concentrated in an individual issuer or in securities with similar risk characteristics. If in management’s judgment, an allowance for credit losses for these exposures is required, the Firm estimates expected credit losses based on the value of the collateral and probability of borrower default.

The net addition to the allowance for credit losses included $1.9 billion, consisting of: • $1.3 billion in consumer, predominantly driven by CCB, comprised of $1.4 billion in Card Services, partially offset by a net reduction of $200 million in Home Lending. The net addition in Card Services was driven by loan growth, including an increase in revolving balances, partially offset by reduced borrower uncertainty. The net reduction in Home Lending was driven by improvements in the outlook for home prices , and • $675 million in wholesale, driven by net downgrade activity, the net effect of changes in the Firm’s weighted average macroeconomic outlook, including deterioration in the outlook for commercial real estate in CB, and an addition for certain accounts receivable in CIB, partially offset by the impact of changes in the loan and lending- related commitment portfolios. The net addition also included $1.2 billion to establish the allowance for the First Republic loans and lending-related commitments in the second quarter of 2023. The changes in the Firm's weighted average macroeconomic outlook also included updates to the central scenario in the third quarter of 2023 to reflect a lower forecasted unemployment rate consistent with a higher growth rate in GDP, and the impact of the additional weight placed on the adverse scenarios in the first quarter of 2023, reflecting elevated recession risks due to high inflation and tightening financial conditions. The allowance for credit losses also reflected a reduction of $587 million as a result of the adoption of changes to the TDR accounting guidance on January 1, 2023. Refer to Note 1 for further information. The Firm's allowance for credit losses is estimated using a weighted average of five internally developed macroeconomic scenarios. The adverse scenarios incorporate more punitive macroeconomic factors than the central case assumptions provided in the table below, resulting in a weighted average U.S. unemployment rate p eaking at 5.5% in the fourth quarter of 2024, and a weighted average U.S. real GDP level that is 1.5% lower than the central case at the end of the second quarter of 2025. The following table presents the Firm’s central case assumptions for the periods presented: Central case assumptions at December 31, 2023 2Q24 4Q24 2Q25 U.S. unemployment rate(a) 4.1 % 4.4 % 4.1 % YoY growth in U.S. real GDP(b) 1.8 % 0.7 % 1.0 % Central case assumptions at December 31, 2022 2Q23 4Q23 2Q24 U.S. unemployment rate(a) 3.8 % 4.3 % 5.0 % YoY growth in U.S. real GDP(b) 1.5 % 0.4 % — % (a) Reflects quarterly average of forecasted U.S. unemployment rate. (b) The year over year growth in U.S. real GDP in the forecast horizon of the central scenario is calculated as the percentage change in U.S. real GDP levels from the prior year. Subsequent changes to this forecast and related estimates will be reflected in the provision for credit losses in future periods.

The following table summarizes the most significant types of Firm-sponsored VIEs by business segment. The Firm considers a “Firm-sponsored” VIE to include any entity where: (1) JPMorgan Chase is the primary beneficiary of the structure; (2) the VIE is used by JPMorgan Chase to securitize Firm assets; (3) the VIE issues financial instruments with the JPMorgan Chase name; or (4) the entity is a JPMorgan Chase–administered asset-backed commercial paper conduit.

As asset manager of the funds, AWM earns a fee based on assets managed; the fee varies with each fund’s investment objective and is competitively priced. For fund entities that qualify as VIEs, AWM’s interests are, in certain cases, considered to be significant variable interests that result in consolidation of the financial results of these entities. • Commercial Banking: CB provides financing and lending-related services to a wide spectrum of clients, including certain third-party-sponsored entities that may meet the definition of a VIE. CB does not control the activities of these entities and does not consolidate these entities. CB’s maximum loss exposure, regardless of whether the entity is a VIE, is generally limited to loans and lending-related commitments which are reported and disclosed in the same manner as any other third- party transaction. • Corporate: Corporate is involved with entities that may meet the definition of VIEs; however these entities are generally subject to specialized investment company accounting, which does not require the consolidation of investments, including VIEs. In addition, Treasury and CIO invest in securities generally issued by third parties which may meet the definition of VIEs (e.g., issuers of asset-backed securities). In general, the Firm does not have the power to direct the significant activities of these entities and therefore does not consolidate these entities. Refer to Note 10 for further information on the Firm’s investment securities portfolio. In addition, CIB also invests in and provides financing and other services to VIEs sponsored by third parties. Refer to page 266 of this Note for more information on the VIEs sponsored by third parties. Significant Firm-sponsored VIEs Credit card securitizations CCB’s Card Services business may securitize originated credit card loans, primarily through the Chase Issuance Trust (the “Trust”). The Firm’s continuing involvement in credit card securitizations includes servicing the receivables, retaining an undivided seller’s interest in the receivables, retaining certain senior and subordinated securities and maintaining escrow accounts. The Firm consolidates the assets and liabilities of its sponsored credit card trusts as it is considered to be the primary beneficiary of these securitization trusts based on the Firm’s ability to direct the activities of these VIEs through its servicing responsibilities and other duties, including making decisions as to the receivables that are transferred into those trusts and as to any related modifications and workouts. Additionally, the nature and extent of the Firm’s other continuing involvement with the trusts, as indicated above, obligates the Firm to absorb losses and gives the Firm the right to receive certain benefits from these VIEs that could potentially be significant. The underlying securitized credit card receivables and other assets of the securitization trusts are available only for payment of the beneficial interests issued by the securitization trusts; they are not available to pay the Firm’s other obligations or the claims of the Firm’s creditors. The agreements with the credit card securitization trusts require the Firm to maintain a minimum undivided interest in the credit card trusts (generally 5%). As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Firm held undivided interests in Firm-sponsored credit card securitization trusts of $4.9 billion and $6.1 billion, respectively. The Firm maintained an average undivided interest in principal receivables owned by those trusts of approximately 65% JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K 261 CCB CIBCIB and 62% for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Firm did not retain any senior securities and retained $1.5 billion of subordinated securities in certain of its credit card securitization trusts at both December 31, 2023 and 2022. The Firm’s undivided interests in the credit card trusts and securities retained are eliminated in consolidation. Firm-sponsored mortgage and other securitization trusts The Firm securitizes (or has securitized) originated and purchased residential mortgages, commercial mortgages and other consumer loans primarily in its CCB and CIB businesses. Depending on the particular transaction, as well as the respective business involved, the Firm may act as the servicer of the loans and/or retain certain beneficial interests in the securitization trusts. The following tables present the total unpaid principal amount of assets held in Firm-sponsored private-label securitization entities, including those in which the Firm has continuing involvement, and those that are consolidated by the Firm. Continuing involvement includes servicing the loans, holding senior interests or subordinated interests (including amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules), recourse or guarantee arrangements, and derivative contracts. In certain instances, the Firm’s only continuing involvement is servicing the loans. The Firm’s maximum loss exposure from retained and purchased interests is the carrying value of these interests.

(b) Consists of securities backed by commercial real estate loans and non-mortgage-related consumer receivables. (c) Excludes the following: retained servicing; securities retained from loan sales and securitization activity related to U.S. GSEs and government agencies; interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives primarily used to manage interest rate and foreign exchange risks of securitization entities; senior securities of $52 million and $134 million at De cember 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and subordinated securities were not material for both December 31, 2023 and 2022, which the Firm purchased in connection with CIB’s secondary market-making activities. (d) Includes interests held in re-securitization transactions. (e) As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, 77% and 84%, respectively, of the Firm’s retained securitization interests, which are predominantly carried at fair val ue and include amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules, were risk-rated “A” or better, on an S&P-equivalent basis. The retained interests in prime residential mortgages consisted of $2.5 billion and $2.6 billion of investment-grade retained interests at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and $88 million and $27 million of noninvestment-grade retained interests at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The retained interests in commercial and other securitization trusts consisted of $6.1 billion and $5.8 billion of investment-grade retained interests, and $1.7 billion and $1.1 billion of noninvestment-grade retained interests at De cember 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

CCB generally retains servicing for all residential mortgage loans it originated or purchased, and for certain mortgage loans purchased by CIB. For securitizations of loans serviced by CCB, the Firm has the power to direct the significant activities of the VIE because it is responsible for decisions related to loan modifications and workouts. CCB may also retain an interest upon securitization. In addition, CIB engages in underwriting and trading activities involving securities issued by Firm-sponsored securitization trusts. As a result, CIB at times retains senior and/or subordinated interests (including residual interests and amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules) in residential mortgage securitizations at the time of securitization, and/or reacquires positions in the secondary market in the normal course of business. In certain instances, as a result of the positions retained or reacquired by CIB or held by Treasury and CIO or CCB, when considered together with the servicing arrangements entered into by CCB, the Firm is deemed to be the primary beneficiary of certain securitization trusts. The Firm does not consolidate residential mortgage securitizations (Firm-sponsored or third-party-sponsored) when it is not the servicer (and therefore does not have the power to direct the most significant activities of the trust) or does not hold a beneficial interest in the trust that could potentially be significant to the trust. Commercial mortgages and other consumer securitizations CIB originates and securitizes commercial mortgage loans, and engages in underwriting and trading activities involving the securities issued by securitization trusts. CIB may retain unsold senior and/or subordinated interests (including amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules) in commercial mortgage securitizations at the time of securitization but, generally, the Firm does not service commercial loan securitizations. Treasury and CIO may choose to invest in these securitizations as well. For commercial mortgage securitizations the power to direct the significant activities of the VIE generally is held by the servicer or investors in a specified class of securities (“controlling class”). The Firm generally does not retain an interest in the controlling class in its sponsored commercial mortgage securitization transactions. Re-securitizations The Firm engages in certain re-securitization transactions in which debt securities are transferred to a VIE in exchange for new beneficial interests. These transfers occur in connection with both U.S. GSEs and government agency sponsored VIEs, which are backed by residential mortgages. The Firm’s consolidation analysis is largely dependent on the Firm’s role and interest in the re-securitization trusts. The following table presents the principal amount of securities transferred to re-securitization VIEs. Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2023 2022 2021 Transfers of securities to VIEs U.S. GSEs and government agencies $ 18,864 $ 16,128 $ 53,923 Most re-securitizations with which the Firm is involved are client-driven transactions in which a specific client or group of clients is seeking a specific return or risk profile. For these transactions, the Firm has concluded that the decision-making power of the entity is shared between the Firm and its clients, considering the joint effort and decisions in establishing the re-securitization trust and its assets, as well as the significant economic interest the client holds in the re-securitization trust; therefore the Firm does not consolidate the re-securitization VIE. The Firm did not transfer any private label securities to re- securitization VIEs during 2023, 2022 and 2021, and retained interests in any such Firm-sponsored VIEs as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 were not material. Additionally, the Firm may invest in beneficial interests of third-party-sponsored re-securitizations and generally purchases these interests in the secondary market. In these circumstances, the Firm does not have the unilateral ability to direct the most significant activities of the re- securitization trust, either because it was not involved in the initial design of the trust, or the Firm was involved with an independent third-party sponsor and demonstrated shared power over the creation of the trust; therefore, the Firm does not consolidate the re-securitization VIE. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K 263 The following table presents information on the Firm's interests in nonconsolidated re-securitization VIEs. Nonconsolidated re-securitization VIEs December 31, (in millions) 2023 2022 U.S. GSEs and government agencies Interest in VIEs $ 3,371 $ 2,580 As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Firm did not consolidate any U.S. GSE and government agency re- securitization VIEs or any Firm-sponsored private-label re- securitization VIEs. Multi-seller conduits Multi-seller conduit entities are separate bankruptcy remote entities that provide secured financing, collateralized by pools of receivables and other financial assets, to customers of the Firm. The conduits fund their financing facilities through the issuance of highly rated commercial paper. The primary source of repayment of the commercial paper is the cash flows from the pools of assets. In most instances, the assets are structured with deal- specific credit enhancements provided to the conduits by the customers (i.e., sellers) or other third parties. Deal- specific credit enhancements are generally structured to cover a multiple of historical losses expected on the pool of assets, and are typically in the form of overcollateralization provided by the seller. The deal-specific credit enhancements mitigate the Firm’s potential losses on its agreements with the conduits. To ensure timely repayment of the commercial paper, and to provide the conduits with funding to provide financing to customers in the event that the conduits do not obtain funding in the commercial paper market, each asset pool financed by the conduits has a minimum 100% deal- specific liquidity facility associated with it provided by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. also provides the multi-seller conduit vehicles with uncommitted program-wide liquidity facilities and program-wide credit enhancement in the form of standby letters of credit. The amount of program-wide credit enhancement required is based upon commercial paper issuance and approximates 10% of the outstanding balance of commercial paper. The Firm consolidates its Firm-administered multi-seller conduits, as the Firm has both the power to direct the significant activities of the conduits and a potentially significant economic interest in the conduits. As administrative agent and in its role in structuring transactions, the Firm makes decisions regarding asset types and credit quality, and manages the commercial paper funding needs of the conduits. The Firm’s interests that could potentially be significant to the VIEs include the fees received as administrative agent and liquidity and program-wide credit enhancement provider, as well as the potential exposure created by the liquidity and credit enhancement facilities provided to the conduits. In the normal course of business, JPMorgan Chase makes markets in and invests in commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. The Firm held $9.8 billion and $13.8 billion of the commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, which have been eliminated in consolidation. The Firm’s investments reflect the Firm’s funding needs and capacity and were not driven by market illiquidity. Other than the amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules, the Firm is not obligated under any agreement to purchase the commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. Deal-specific liquidity facilities, program-wide liquidity and credit enhancement provided by the Firm have been eliminated in consolidation. The Firm or the Firm- administered multi-seller conduits provide lending-related commitments to certain clients of the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. The unfunded commitments were $10.8 billion and $10.6 billion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and are reported as off-balance sheet lending-related commitments in other unfunded commitments to extend credit. Refer to Note 28 for more information on off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. Municipal bond vehicles Municipal bond vehicles or tender option bond (“TOB”) trusts allow institutions to finance their municipal bond investments at short-term rates. In a typical TOB transaction, the trust purchases highly rated municipal bond(s) of a single issuer and funds the purchase by issuing two types of securities: (1) puttable floating-rate certificates (“floaters”) and (2) inverse floating-rate residual interests (“residuals”). The floaters are typically purchased by money market funds or other short-term investors and may be tendered, with requisite notice, to the TOB trust. The residuals are retained by the investor seeking to finance its municipal bond investment. TOB transactions where the residual is held by a third-party investor are typically known as customer TOB trusts, and non-customer TOB trusts are transactions where the Residual is retained by the Firm. Customer TOB trusts are sponsored by a third party. The Firm serves as sponsor for all non-customer TOB transactions. The Firm may provide various services to a TOB trust, including remarketing agent, liquidity or tender option provider, and/or sponsor. J.P. Morgan Securities LLC may serve as a remarketing agent on the floaters for TOB trusts. The remarketing agent is responsible for establishing the periodic variable rate on the floaters, conducting the initial placement and remarketing tendered floater s. The remarketing agent may, but is not obligated to, make markets in floaters. Floaters held by the Firm were not material during 2023 and 2022. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. or J.P. Morgan Securities LLC often serves as the sole liquidity or tender option provider for the TOB trusts. The liquidity provider’s obligation to perform is conditional and is limited by certain events Notes to consolidated financial statements 264 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K Nonconsolidated re-securitization VIEs (“Termination Events”), which include bankruptcy or failure to pay by the municipal bond issuer or credit enhancement provider, an event of taxability on the municipal bonds or the immediate downgrade of the municipal bond to below investment grade. In addition, the liquidity provider’s exposure is typically further limited by the high credit quality of the underlying municipal bonds, the excess collateralization in the vehicle, or, in certain transactions, the reimbursement agreements with the Residual holders. Holders of the floaters may “put,” or tender, their floaters to the TOB trust. If the remarketing agent cannot successfully remarket the floaters to another investor, the liquidity provider either provides a loan to the TOB trust for the TOB trust’s purchase of the floaters, or it directly purchases the tendered floaters. TOB trusts are considered to be variable interest entities. The Firm consolidates non-customer TOB trusts because as the Residual holder, the Firm has the right to make decisions that significantly impact the economic performance of the municipal bond vehicle, and it has the right to receive benefits and bear losses that could potentially be significant to the municipal bond vehicle. Consolidated VIE assets and liabilities The following table presents information on assets and liabilities related to VIEs consolidated by the Firm as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.

(b) Includes assets classified as cash and other assets on the Consolidated balance sheets. (c) The assets of the consolidated VIEs included in the program types above are used to settle the liabilities of those entities. The assets and liabilities include third-party assets and liabilities of consolidated VIEs and exclude intercompany balances that eliminate in consolidation. (d) The interest-bearing beneficial interest liabilities issued by consolidated VIEs are classified in the line item on the Consolidated balance sheets titled, “Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs”. The holders of these beneficial interests generally do not have recourse to the general credit of JPMorgan Chase. Included in beneficial interests in VIE assets are long-term beneficial interests of $3.1 billion and $2.1 billion at De cember 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. (e) Includes liabilities classified as accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets. (f) Primarily includes purchased supply chain finance receivables and purchased auto loan securitizations in CIB. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K 265 Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities Assets Assets VIEs sponsored by third parties The Firm enters into transactions with VIEs structured by other parties. These include, for example, acting as a derivative counterparty, liquidity provider, investor, underwriter, placement agent, remarketing agent, trustee or custodian. These transactions are conducted at arm’s- length, and individual credit decisions are based on the analysis of the specific VIE, taking into consideration the quality of the underlying assets. Where the Firm does not have the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance, or a variable interest that could potentially be significant, the Firm generally does not consolidate the VIE, but it records and reports these positions on its Consolidated balance sheets in the same manner it would record and report positions in respect of any other third-party transaction. Tax credit vehicles The Firm holds investments in unconsolidated tax credit vehicles, which are limited partnerships and similar entities that own and operate affordable housing, energy, and other projects. These entities are primarily considered VIEs. A third party is typically the general partner or managing member and has control over the significant activities of the tax credit vehicles, and accordingly the Firm does not consolidate tax credit vehicles. The Firm generally invests in these partnerships as a limited partner and earns a return primarily through the receipt of tax credits allocated to the projects. The maximum loss exposure, represented by equity investments and funding commitments, was $35.1 billion and $30.2 billion, of which $14.7 billion and $10.6 billion was unfunded at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Firm assesses each project and to reduce the risk of loss, may withhold varying amounts of its capital investment until the project qualifies for tax credits. Refer to Note 25 for further information on affordable housing tax credits and Note 28 for more information on off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. Customer municipal bond vehicles (TOB trusts) The Firm may provide various services to customer TOB trusts, including remarketing agent, liquidity or tender option provider. In certain customer TOB transactions, the Firm, as liquidity provider, has entered into a reimbursement agreement with the Residual holder. In those transactions, upon the termination of the vehicle, the Firm has recourse to the third-party Residual holders for any shortfall. The Firm does not have any intent to protect Residual holders from potential losses on any of the underlying municipal bonds. The Firm does not consolidate customer TOB trusts, since the Firm does not have the power to make decisions that significantly impact the economic performance of the municipal bond vehicle. The Firm’s maximum exposure as a liquidity provider to customer TOB trusts at December 31, 2023 and 2022, was $5.1 billion and $5.8 billion, respectively. The fair value of assets held by such VIEs at December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $7.3 billion and $8.2 billion respectively. Loan securitizations The Firm has securitized and sold a variety of loans, including residential mortgages, credit card receivables, commercial mortgages and other consumer loans. The purposes of these securitization transactions were to satisfy investor demand and to generate liquidity for the Firm. For loan securitizations in which the Firm is not required to consolidate the trust, the Firm records the transfer of the loan receivable to the trust as a sale when all of the following accounting criteria for a sale are met: (1) the transferred financial assets are legally isolated from the Firm’s creditors; (2) the transferee or beneficial interest holder can pledge or exchange the transferred financial assets; and (3) the Firm does not maintain effective control over the transferred financial assets (e.g., the Firm cannot repurchase the transferred assets before their maturity and it does not have the ability to unilaterally cause the holder to return the transferred assets). For loan securitizations accounted for as a sale, the Firm recognizes a gain or loss based on the difference between the value of proceeds received (including cash, beneficial interests, or servicing assets received) and the carrying value of the assets sold. Gains and losses on securitizations are reported in noninterest revenue. Notes to consolidated financial statements 266 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K Securitization activity The following table provides information related to the Firm’s securitization activities for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, related to assets held in Firm-sponsored securitization entities that were not consolidated by the Firm, and where sale accounting was achieved at the time of the securitization. 2023 2022 2021 Year ended December 31, (in millions) Residential mortgage(d) Commercial and other(e) Residential mortgage(d) Commercial and other(e) Residential mortgage(d) Commercial and other(e) Principal securitized $ 7,678 $ 3,901 $ 10,218 $ 9,036 $ 23,876 $ 14,917 All cash flows during the period:(a) Proceeds received from loan sales as financial instruments(b)(c) $ 7,251 $ 3,896 $ 9,783 $ 8,921 $ 24,450 $ 15,044 Servicing fees collected 24 5 62 2 153 1 Cash flows received on interests 325 425 489 285 578 273 (a) Excludes re-securitization transactions.

These loans and excess MSRs are sold primarily for the purpose of securitization by the U.S. GSEs, who provide certain guarantee provisions (e.g., credit enhancement of the loans). The Firm also sells loans into securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae guidelines; these loans are typically insured or guaranteed by another U.S. government agency. The Firm does not consolidate the securitization vehicles underlying these transactions as it is not the primary beneficiary. For a limited number of loan sales, the Firm is obligated to share a portion of the credit risk associated with the sold loans with the purchaser. Refer to Note 28 for additional information about the Firm’s loan sales- and securitization- related indemnifications and Note 15 for additional information about the impact of the Firm’s sale of certain excess MSRs. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K 267 2023 2022 2021 The following table summarizes the activities related to loans sold to the U.S. GSEs, and loans in securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae guidelines.

(e) The carrying value of the loans accounted for at fair value approximated the proceeds received upon loan sale. Options to repurchase delinquent loans In addition to the Firm’s obligation to repurchase certain loans due to material breaches of representations and warranties as discussed in Note 28, the Firm also has the option to repurchase delinquent loans that it services for Ginnie Mae loan pools, as well as for other U.S. government agencies under certain arrangements. The Firm typically elects to repurchase delinquent loans from Ginnie Mae loan pools as it continues to service them and/or manage the foreclosure process in accordance with the applicable requirements, and such loans continue to be insured or guaranteed. When the Firm’s repurchase option becomes exercisable, such loans must be reported on the Consolidated balance sheets as a loan with a corresponding liability. Refer to Note 12 for additional information. The following table presents loans the Firm repurchased or had an option to repurchase, real estate owned, and foreclosed government-guaranteed residential mortgage loans recognized on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. Substantially all of the loans and real estate owned are insured or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies.

Subsequent to initial recognition, goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or more often if events or circumstances, such as adverse changes in the business climate, indicate that there may be an impairment. The goodwill associated with each business combination is allocated to the related reporting units, which are generally determined based on how the Firm’s businesses are managed and how they are reviewed. The following table presents goodwill attributed to the reportable business segments and Corporate.

For 2021, represents goodwill associated with the acquisitions of Nutmeg in Corporate, OpenInvest and Campbell Global in AWM, and Frank and The Infatuation in CCB. (b) Predominantly foreign currency adjustments. Goodwill impairment testing The Firm’s goodwill was not impaired at December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021. The goodwill impairment test is generally performed by comparing the current fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value. If the fair value is in excess of the carrying value, then the reporting unit’s goodwill is considered not to be impaired. If the fair value is less than the carrying value, then an impairment is recognized for the amount by which the reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value, up to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The Firm uses the reporting units’ allocated capital plus goodwill and other intangible assets as a proxy for the carrying values of equity for the reporting units in the goodwill impairment testing. Reporting unit equity is determined on a similar basis as the allocation of capital to the LOBs which takes into consideration a variety of factors including capital levels of similarly rated peers and applicable regulatory capital requirements. LOB’s allocated capital levels are incorporated into the Firm’s annual budget process, which is reviewed by the Firm’s Board of Directors and Operating Committee. Allocated capital is further reviewed at least annually and updated as needed. The primary method the Firm uses to estimate the fair value of its reporting units is the income approach. This approach projects cash flows for the forecast period and uses the perpetuity growth method to calculate terminal values. These cash flows and terminal values, which are based on the reporting units’ annual budgets and forecasts are then discounted using an appropriate discount rate. The discount rate used for each reporting unit represents an estimate of the cost of equity for that reporting unit and is determined considering the Firm’s overall estimated cost of equity (estimated using the Capital Asset Pricing Model), as adjusted for the risk characteristics specific to each reporting unit (for example, for higher levels of risk or uncertainty associated with the business or management’s forecasts and assumptions). To assess the reasonableness of the discount rates used for each reporting unit, management compares the discount rate to the estimated cost of equity for publicly traded institutions with similar businesses and risk characteristics. In addition, the weighted average cost of equity (aggregating the various reporting units) is compared with the Firm’s overall estimated cost of equity for reasonableness. The valuations derived from the discounted cash flow analysis are then compared with market-based trading and transaction multiples for relevant competitors. Trading and transaction comparables are used as general indicators to assess the overall reasonableness of the estimated fair values, although precise conclusions generally cannot be drawn due to the differences that naturally exist between the Firm’s businesses and competitor institutions. The Firm also takes into consideration a comparison between the aggregate fair values of the Firm’s reporting JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K 269 units and JPMorgan Chase’s market capitalization. In evaluating this comparison, the Firm considers several factors, including (i) a control premium that would exist in a market transaction, (ii) factors related to the level of execution risk that would exist at the Firmwide level that do not exist at the reporting unit level and (iii) short-term market volatility and other factors that do not directly affect the value of individual reporting units. Unanticipated declines in business performance, increases in credit losses, increases in capital requirements, as well as deterioration in economic or market conditions, adverse regulatory or legislative changes or increases in the estimated market cost of equity, could cause the estimated fair values of the Firm’s reporting units to decline in the future, which could result in a material impairment loss to earnings in a future period related to some portion of the associated goodwill. Mortgage servicing rights MSRs represent the fair value of expected future cash flows for performing servicing activities for others. The fair value considers estimated future servicing fees and ancillary revenue, offset by estimated costs to service the loans, and generally declines over time as net servicing cash flows are received, effectively amortizing the MSR asset against contractual servicing and ancillary fee income. MSRs are either purchased from third parties or recognized upon sale or securitization of mortgage loans if servicing is retained. As permitted by U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to account for its MSRs at fair value. The Firm treats its MSRs as a single class of servicing assets based on the availability of market inputs used to measure the fair value of its MSR asset and its treatment of MSRs as one aggregate pool for risk management purposes. The Firm estimates the fair value of MSRs using an option-adjusted spread (“OAS”) model, which projects MSR cash flows over multiple interest rate scenarios in conjunction with the Firm’s prepayment model, and then discounts these cash flows at risk-adjusted rates. The model considers portfolio characteristics, contractually specified servicing fees, prepayment assumptions, delinquency rates, costs to service, late charges and other ancillary revenue, and other economic factors. The Firm compares fair value estimates and assumptions to observable market data where available, and also considers recent market activity and actual portfolio experience. Notes to consolidated financial statements 270 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K The fair value of MSRs is sensitive to changes in interest rates, including their effect on prepayment speeds. MSRs typically decrease in value when interest rates decline because declining interest rates tend to increase prepayments and therefore reduce the expected life of the net servicing cash flows that comprise the MSR asset. Conversely, securities (e.g., mortgage-backed securities), and certain derivatives (e.g., those for which the Firm receives fixed-rate interest payments) increase in value when interest rates decline. JPMorgan Chase uses combinations of derivatives and securities to manage the risk of changes in the fair value of MSRs. The intent is to offset any interest-rate related changes in the fair value of MSRs with changes in the fair value of the related risk management instruments. The following table summarizes MSR activity for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021. As of or for the year ended December 31, (in millions, except where otherwise noted) 2023 2022 2021 Fair value at beginning of period $ 7,973 $ 5,494 $ 3,276 MSR activity: Originations of MSRs 253 798 1,659 Purchase of MSRs(a) 1,028 1,400 1,363 Disposition of MSRs(b) (188) (822) (114) Net additions/(dispositions) 1,093 1,376 2,908 Changes due to collection/realization of expected cash flows (1,011) (936) (788) Changes in valuation due to inputs and assumptions: Changes due to market interest rates and other(c) 424 2,022 404 Changes in valuation due to other inputs and assumptions: Projected cash flows (e.g., cost to service) (22) 14 109 Discount rates 14 — — Prepayment model changes and other(d) 51 3 (415) Total changes in valuation due to other inputs and assumptions 43 17 (306) Total changes in valuation due to inputs and assumptions 467 2,039 98 Fair value at December 31, $ 8,522 $ 7,973 $ 5,494 Change in unrealized gains/(losses) included in income related to MSRs held at December 31, $ 467 $ 2,039 $ 98 Contractual service fees, late fees and other ancillary fees included in income 1,590 1,535 1,298 Third-party mortgage loans serviced at December 31, (in billions) 632 584 520 Servicer advances, net of an allowance for uncollectible amounts, at December 31(e) 659 758 1,611 (a) Includes purchase price adjustments associated with MSRs purchased, primarily as a result of loans that prepaid within 90 days of settlement, allowing the Firm to recover the purchase price. (b) Includes excess MSRs transferred to agency-sponsored trusts in exchange for stripped mortgage-backed securities (“SMBS”). In each transaction, a portion of the SMBS was acquired by third parties at the transaction date; the Firm acquired the remaining balance of those SMBS as trading securities. (c) Represents both the impact of changes in estimated future prepayments due to changes in market interest rates, and the difference between actual and expected prepayments. (d) Represents changes in prepayments other than those attributable to changes in market interest rates. (e) Represents amounts the Firm pays as the servicer (e.g., scheduled principal and interest, taxes and insurance), which will generally be reimbursed within a short period of time after the advance from future cash flows from the trust or the underlying loans. The Firm’s credit risk associated with these servicer advances is minimal because reimbursement of the advances is typically senior to all cash payments to investors. In addition, the Firm maintains the right to stop payment to investors if the collateral is insufficient to cover the advance. However, certain of these servicer advances may not be recoverable if they were not made in accordance with applicable rules and agreements. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K 271 The following table presents the components of mortgage fees and related income (including the impact of MSR risk management activities) for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.

(b) Represents the aggregate impact of changes in model inputs and assumptions such as projected cash flows (e.g., cost to service), discount rates and changes in prepayments other than those attributable to changes in market interest rates (e.g., changes in prepayments due to changes in home prices). Changes in fair value based on variations in assumptions generally cannot be easily extrapolated, because the relationship of the change in the assumptions to the change in fair value are often highly interrelated and may not be linear. In the following table, the effect that a change in a particular assumption may have on the fair value is calculated without changing any other assumption. In reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another, which would either magnify or counteract the impact of the initial change. The table below outlines the key economic assumptions used to determine the fair value of the Firm’s MSRs at December 31, 2023 and 2022, and outlines the sensitivities of those fair values to immediate adverse changes in those assumptions, as defined below.

Notes to consolidated financial statements 272 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K Other intangible assets The Firm’s finite-lived and indefinite-lived other intangible assets are initially recorded at their fair value primarily upon completion of a business combination. Subsequently, the Firm’s finite-lived intangible assets, including core deposit intangibles, customer relationship intangibles, and certain other intangible assets, are amortized over their useful lives, estimated based on the expected future economic benefits to the Firm of the intangible asset. The Firm’s intangible assets with indefinite lives, such as asset management contracts, are not subject to amortization and are assessed periodically for impairment. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the gross carrying values of other intangible assets were $4.2 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively, and the accumulated amortization was $994 million and $679 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the net carrying values consist of finite-lived intangible assets of $2.0 billion and $707 million, respectively, as well as indefinite-lived intangible assets, which are not subject to amortization, of $1.2 billion and $517 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, other intangible assets reflected core deposit and certain wealth management customer relationship intangibles related to the First Republic acquisition, and asset management contracts related to the Firm’s acquisition of the remaining 51% interest in CIFM. Refer to Note 34 for additional information on the First Republic acquisition. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, amortization expense was $315 million and $145 million, respectively. The following table presents estimated future amortization expense.

Once the Firm determines that an impairment exists for an intangible asset, the impairment is recognized in other expense. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K 273 Note 16 – Premises and equipment Premises and equipment includes land carried at cost, as well as buildings, leasehold improvements, internal-use software and furniture and equipment carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. The Firm’s operating lease right-of-use assets are also included in Premises and equipment. Refer to Note 18 for a further discussion of the Firm’s right-of-use assets. The following table presents certain components of Premises and equipment.

(b) Other premises and equipment is comprised of internal-use software and furniture and equipment. JPMorgan Chase computes depreciation using the straight- line method over the estimated useful life for buildings and furniture and equipment. The Firm depreciates leasehold improvements over the lesser of the remainder of the lease term or the estimated useful life. The Firm also capitalizes certain costs associated with the acquisition or development of internal-use software. Once the software is ready for its intended use, these costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the software’s expected useful life. The estimated useful lives range from 10 to 50 years for buildings and leasehold improvements, and 3 to 10 years for internal-use software and furniture and equipment. Impairment is assessed when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be fully recoverable.

These leases generally have terms of 20 years or less, determined based on the contractual maturity of the lease, and include periods covered by options to extend or terminate the lease when the Firm is reasonably certain that it will exercise those options. All leases with lease terms greater than twelve months are reported as a lease liability with a corresponding right-of-use (“ROU”) asset. None of these lease agreements impose restrictions on the Firm’s ability to pay dividends, engage in debt or equity financing transactions or enter into further lease agreements. Certain of these leases contain escalation clauses that will increase rental payments based on maintenance, utility and tax increases, which are non-lease components. The Firm elected not to separate lease and non-lease components of a contract for its real estate leases. As such, real estate lease payments represent payments on both lease and non-lease components. Operating lease liabilities and ROU assets are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term. The future lease payments are discounted at a rate that estimates the Firm’s collateralized borrowing rate for financing instruments of a similar term and are included in accounts payable and other liabilities. The operating lease ROU assets, predominantly included in premises and equipment, also include any lease prepayments made, plus initial direct costs incurred, less any lease incentives received. Rental expense associated with operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, and generally included in occupancy expense in the Consolidated statements of income. The carrying values of the Firm’s operating leases were as follows: December 31, (in millions, except where otherwise noted) 2023 2022 Right-of-use assets $ 8,431 (a) $ 7,782 Lease liabilities 8,833 (b) 8,183 Weighted average remaining lease term (in years) 8.4 8.4 Weighted average discount rate 4.01 % 3.55 % Supplemental cash flow information Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities - operating cash flows $ 1,662 $ 1,613 Supplemental non-cash information Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for operating lease obligations $ 2,094 $ 1,435 (a) Included $647 million of right-of-use assets associated with First Republic.

These operating leases will commence between 2024 and 2026 with lease terms up to 21 years. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K 275 Firm as lessor The Firm provides auto and equipment lease financing to its customers through lease arrangements with lease terms that may contain renewal, termination and/or purchase options. The Firm’s lease financings are predominantly auto operating leases. These assets subject to operating leases are recognized in other assets on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets and are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the lease term to reduce the asset to its estimated residual value. Depreciation expense is included in technology, communications and equipment expense in the Consolidated statements of income. The Firm’s lease income is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is included in other income in the Consolidated statements of income. On a periodic basis, the Firm assesses leased assets for impairment, and if the carrying amount of the leased asset exceeds the undiscounted cash flows from the lease payments and the estimated residual value upon disposition of the leased asset, an impairment is recognized. The risk of loss on auto and equipment leased assets relating to the residual value of the leased assets is monitored through projections of the asset residual values at lease origination and periodic review of residual values, and is mitigated through arrangements with certain manufacturers or lessees. The following table presents the carrying value of assets subject to leases reported on the Consolidated balance sheets: December 31, (in millions) 2023 2022 Carrying value of assets subject to operating leases, net of accumulated depreciation $ 10,663 $ 12,302 Accumulated depreciation 3,288 4,282 The following table presents the Firm’s operating lease income and the related depreciation expense on the Consolidated statements of income: Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2023 2022 2021 Operating lease income $ 2,843 $ 3,654 $ 4,914 Depreciation expense 1,778 2,475 3,380 The following table presents future receipts under operating leases as of December 31, 2023: Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2024 $ 1,868 2025 1,158 2026 451 2027 32 2028 9 After 2028 8 Total future minimum lease receipts $ 3,526 Notes to consolidated financial statements 276 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K Note 19 – Accounts payable and other liabilities Accounts payable and other liabilities consist of brokerage payables, which include payables to customers and payables related to security purchases that did not settle, as well as other accrued expenses, such as compensation accruals, credit card rewards liability, operating lease liabilities, accrued interest payables, merchant servicing payables, income tax payables and litigation reserves. The following table presents the components of accounts payable and other liabilities.

The credit card rewards liability represents the estimated cost of rewards points earned and expected to be redeemed by cardholders. The liability is accrued as the cardholder earns the benefit and is reduced when the cardholder redeems points. The redemption rate and cost per point assumptions are key assumptions to estimate the liability and the current period impact is recognized in Card Income. Refer to Note 7, 18, 25 and 30 for additional information on accrued interest, operating lease liabilities, income taxes and litigation reserves, respectively. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K 277 Note 20 – Long-term debt JPMorgan Chase issues long-term debt denominated in various currencies, predominantly U.S. dollars, with both fixed and variable interest rates.

Notes to consolidated financial statements 278 J PMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K 202320232023 The weighted-average contractual interest rates for total long-term debt excluding structured notes accounted for at fair value were 3.65% and 3.26% as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. In order to modify exposure to interest rate and currency exchange rate movements, JPMorgan Chase utilizes derivative instruments, primarily interest rate and cross-currency interest rate swaps, in conjunction with some of its debt issuances. The use of these instruments modifies the Firm’s interest expense on the associated debt. The modified weighted-average interest rates for total long-term debt, including the effects of related derivative instruments, were 5.20% and 4.89% as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. JPMorgan Chase & Co. has guaranteed certain long-term debt of its subsidiaries, including structured notes. These guarantees rank pari passu with the Firm’s other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The amount of such guaranteed long-term debt and structured notes was $41.1 billion and $28.2 billion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Firm’s unsecured debt does not contain requirements that would call for an acceleration of payments, maturities or changes in the structure of the existing debt, provide any limitations on future borrowings or require additional collateral, based on unfavorable changes in the Firm’s credit ratings, financial ratios, earnings or stock price. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K 279 Note 21 – Preferred stock At December 31, 2023 and 2022, JPMorgan Chase was authorized to issue 200 million shares of preferred stock, in one or more series, with a par value of $1 per share.

Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2023 2022 2021 Total issued – balance at January 1 4,104.9 4,104.9 4,104.9 Treasury – balance at January 1 (1,170.7) (1,160.8) (1,055.5) Repurchase (69.5) (23.1) (119.7) Reissuance: Employee benefits and compensation plans 10.9 12.0 13.5 Employee stock purchase plans 1.0 1.2 0.9 Total reissuance 11.9 13.2 14.4 Total treasury – balance at December 31 (1,228.3) (1,170.7) (1,160.8) Outstanding at December 31 2,876.6 2,934.2 2,944.1 Effective May 1, 2022, the Firm is authorized to purchase up to $30 billion under its common share repurchase program previously approved by the Board of Directors, which was announced on April 13, 2022. The following table sets forth the Firm’s repurchases of common stock for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021. Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2023 2022(b) 2021(c) Total number of shares of common stock repurchased 69.5 23.1 119.7 Aggregate purchase price of common stock repurchases(a) $ 9,898 $ 3,122 $ 18,448 (a) Excludes excise tax and commissions. As part of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, a 1% excise tax was imposed on net share repurchases effective January 1, 2023. (b) In the second half of 2022, the Firm temporarily suspended share repurchases, which it resumed under its current common share repurchase program in the first quarter of 2023. (c) As directed by the Federal Reserve, total net repurchases and common stock dividends in the first and second quarter of 2021 were restricted and could not exceed the average of the Firm’s net income for the four preceding calendar quarters. Effective July 1, 2021, the Firm became subject to the normal capital distribution restrictions provided under the regulatory capital framework. The Board of Directors’ authorization to repurchase common shares is utilized at management’s discretion, and the timing of purchases and the exact amount of common shares that may be repurchased is subject to various factors, including market conditions; legal and regulatory considerations affecting the amount and timing of repurchase activity; the Firm’s capital position (taking into account goodwill and intangibles); internal capital generation; current and proposed future capital requirements; and alternative investment opportunities. The $30 billion common share repurchase program approved by the Board does not establish specific price targets or timetables. The repurchase program may be suspended by management at any time; and may be executed through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, or utilizing Rule 10b5-1 plans, which are written trading plans that the Firm may enter into from time to time under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and which allow the Firm to repurchase its common shares during periods when it may otherwise not be repurchasing common shares — for example, during internal trading blackout periods. As of December 31, 2023, approximately 61.6 million shares of common stock were reserved for issuance under various employee incentive, compensation, option and stock purchase plans, and directors’ compensation plans. Notes to consolidated financial statements 282 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K Note 23 – Earnings per share Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) is calculated using the two-class method. Under the two-class method, all earnings (distributed and undistributed) are allocated to common stock and participating securities. JPMorgan Chase grants RSUs under its share-based compensation programs, predominantly all of which entitle recipients to receive nonforfeitable dividends during the vesting period on a basis equivalent to dividends paid to holders of the Firm’s common stock. These unvested RSUs meet the definition of participating securities based on their respective rights to receive nonforfeitable dividends, and they are treated as a separate class of securities in computing basic EPS. Participating securities are not included as incremental shares in computing diluted EPS; refer to Note 9 for additional information. Diluted EPS incorporates the potential impact of contingently issuable shares, including awards which require future service as a condition of delivery of the underlying common stock. Diluted EPS is calculated under both the two-class and treasury stock methods, and the more dilutive amount is reported. For each of the periods presented in the table below, diluted EPS calculated under the two-class method was more dilutive. The following table presents the calculation of net income applicable to common stockholders and basic and diluted EPS for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021. Year ended December 31, (in millions, except per share amounts) 2023 2022 2021 Basic earnings per share Net income $ 49,552 $ 37,676 $ 48,334 Less: Preferred stock dividends 1,501 1,595 1,600 Net income applicable to common equity 48,051 36,081 46,734 Less: Dividends and undistributed earnings allocated to participating securities 291 189 231 Net income applicable to common stockholders $ 47,760 $ 35,892 $ 46,503 Total weighted-average basic shares outstanding 2,938.6 2,965.8 3,021.5 Net income per share $ 16.25 $ 12.10 $ 15.39 Diluted earnings per share Net income applicable to common stockholders $ 47,760 $ 35,892 $ 46,503 Total weighted-average basic shares outstanding 2,938.6 2,965.8 3,021.5 Add: Dilutive impact of unvested PSUs, nondividend-earning RSUs and SARs 4.5 4.2 5.1 Total weighted-average diluted shares outstanding 2,943.1 2,970.0 3,026.6 Net income per share $ 16.23 $ 12.09 $ 15.36 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K 283 Note 24 – Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) AOCI includes the after-tax change in unrealized gains and losses on investment securities, foreign currency translation adjustments (including the impact of related derivatives), fair value changes of excluded components on fair value hedges, cash flow hedging activities, net gain/(loss) related to the Firm’s defined benefit pension and OPEB plans, and fair value option-elected liabilities arising from changes in the Firm’s own credit risk (DVA).

(b) Reclassifications of pre-tax realized gains/(losses) on translation adjustments and related hedges are reported in other income/expense in the Consolidated statements of income. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Firm reclassified a net pre-tax loss of $(3) million to other revenue, $(35) million related to the net investment hedge loss, and a $32 million gain related to cumulative translation adjustment, including the impact of the acquisit ion of CIFM. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Firm reclassified a net pre-tax loss of $(8) million. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Firm reclassified a net pre-tax loss of $(7) million. (c) R epresents changes in fair value of cross-currency swaps attributable to changes in cross-currency basis spreads, which are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recorded in other comprehensive income. The initial cost of cross-currency basis spreads is recognized in earnings as part of the accrual of interest on the cross-currency swaps. (d) The pre-tax amounts are primarily recorded in noninterest revenue, net interest income and compensation expense in the Consolidated statements of income. (e) During the year ended De cember 31, 2022, a remeasurement of the Firm’s U.S. principal defined benefit plan in the third quarter, was required as a result of a pension settlement. The remeasurement resulted in a net decrease of $1.4 billion in pre-tax AOCI. Refer to Note 8 for further information. Notes to consolidated financial statements 284 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K 2023 2022 20212023 2022 2021 Note 25 – Income taxes JPMorgan Chase and its eligible subsidiaries file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return. JPMorgan Chase uses the asset and liability method to provide for income taxes on all transactions recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements. This method requires that income taxes reflect the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities for book and tax purposes. Accordingly, a deferred tax asset or liability for each temporary difference is determined based on the tax rates that the Firm expects to be in effect when the underlying items of income and expense are realized. JPMorgan Chase’s expense for income taxes includes the current and deferred portions of that expense. A valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount the Firm expects to realize. Due to the inherent complexities arising from the nature of the Firm’s businesses, and from conducting business and being taxed in a substantial number of jurisdictions, significant judgments and estimates are required to be made. Agreement of tax liabilities between JPMorgan Chase and the many tax jurisdictions in which the Firm files tax returns may not be finalized for several years. Thus, the Firm’s final tax-related assets and liabilities may ultimately be different from those currently reported. Effective tax rate and expense The following table presents a reconciliation of the applicable statutory U.S. federal income tax rate to the effective tax rate. Effective tax rate Year ended December 31, 2023 2022 2021 Statutory U.S. federal tax rate 21.0 % 21.0 % 21.0 % Increase/(decrease) in tax rate resulting from: U.S. state and local income taxes, net of U.S. federal income tax benefit 2.8 3.5 3.0 Tax-exempt income (0.9) (0.9) (0.9) Non-U.S. earnings 1.5 0.4 0.1 Business tax credits (4.4) (5.4) (4.2) Other, net (0.4) (0.2) (0.1) Effective tax rate 19.6 % (a) 18.4 % 18.9 % (a) Income tax expense associated with the First Republic acquisition was reflected in the estimated bargain purchase gain, which resulted in a reduction in the Firm’s effective tax rate. The following table reflects the components of income tax expense/(benefit) included in the Consolidated statements of income. Income tax expense/(benefit) Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2023 2022 2021 Current income tax expense/ (benefit) U.S. federal $ 8,973 $ 5,606 $ 2,865 Non-U.S. 4,355 2,992 2,718 U.S. state and local 3,266 2,630 1,897 Total current income tax expense/ (benefit) 16,594 11,228 7,480 Deferred income tax expense/ (benefit) U.S. federal (3,475) (2,004) 3,460 Non-U.S. 35 (154) (101) U.S. state and local (1,094) (580) 389 Total deferred income tax expense/(benefit) (4,534) (2,738) 3,748 Total income tax expense $ 12,060 $ 8,490 $ 11,228 Total income tax expense includes $68 million of tax benefits in 2023, $331 million of tax benefits in 2022, and $69 million of tax expenses in 2021, resulting from the resolution of tax audits. Tax effect of items recorded in stockholders’ equity The preceding table does not reflect the tax effect of certain items that are recorded each period directly in stockholders’ equity, which are predominantly reflected in OCI as disclosed in Note 24. For the year ended December 31, 2023, stockholders’ equity also reflected the tax effect associated with the Firm’s adoption of the TDR accounting guidance recognized in retained earnings. Refer to Note 1 for further information. Results from U.S. and non-U.S. earnings The following table presents the U.S. and non-U.S. components of income before income tax expense. Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2023 2022 2021 U.S. $ 46,868 $ 34,626 $ 50,126 Non-U.S.(a) 14,744 11,540 9,436 Income before income tax expense $ 61,612 $ 46,166 $ 59,562 (a) For purposes of this table, non-U.S. income is defined as income generated from operations located outside the U.S. The Firm will recognize any U.S. income tax expense it may incur on global intangible low tax income as income tax expense in the period in which the tax is incurred. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K 285 Affordable housing tax credits The Firm recognized $2.0 billion of tax credits and other tax benefits associated with investments in affordable housing projects within income tax expense for the year ended 2023, and $1.8 billion and $1.7 billion for the years ended 2022 and 2021, respectively. The amount of amortization of such investments reported in income tax expense was $1.6 billion, $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively. The carrying value of these investments, which are reported in other assets on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets, was $14.6 billion and $12.1 billion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The amount of commitments related to these investments, which are reported in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets, was $6.8 billion and $5.4 billion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Deferred taxes Deferred income tax expense/(benefit) reflects the differences between assets and liabilities measured for financial reporting purposes versus income tax return purposes. Deferred tax assets are recognized if, in management’s judgment, their realizability is determined to be more likely than not. If a deferred tax asset is determined to be unrealizable, a valuation allowance is established. The significant components of deferred tax assets and liabilities are reflected in the following table, the net deferred tax assets are reflected in other assets on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets. December 31, (in millions) 2023 2022 Deferred tax assets Allowance for loan losses $ 5,809 $ 5,193 Employee benefits 1,247 1,342 Accrued expenses and other 9,887 (a) 8,577 Non-U.S. operations 860 1,148 Tax attribute carryforwards 290 365 Gross deferred tax assets 18,093 16,625 Valuation allowance (183) (198) Deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance $ 17,910 $ 16,427 Deferred tax liabilities Depreciation and amortization $ 779 $ 2,044 Mortgage servicing rights, net of hedges 1,794 1,864 Leasing transactions 2,254 2,843 Other, net 2,935 3,801 Gross deferred tax liabilities 7,762 10,552 Net deferred tax assets $ 10,148 $ 5,875 (a) Includes the estimated net deferred tax asset associated with the First Republic acquisition. The allocation of the tax basis to individual assets may be refined during the measurement period, which could result in an impact to the gross deferred tax assets and liabilities. JPMorgan Chase has recorded deferred tax assets of $290 million at December 31, 2023 in connection with tax attribute carryforwards. State and local capital loss carryforwards were $1.2 billion, U.S. federal NOL carryforwards were $586 million, non-U.S. NOL carryforwards were $570 million, and other U.S. federal tax attributes were $118 million. If not utilized, a portion of the U.S. federal NOL carryforwards and other U.S. federal tax attributes will expire between 2026 and 2037 whereas others have an unlimited carryforward period. Similarly, certain non-U.S. NOL carryforwards will expire between 2026 and 2040 whereas others have an unlimited carryforward period. The state and local capital loss carryforwards will expire in 2026 and 2027. The valuation allowance at December 31, 2023, was due to the state and local capital loss carryforwards and certain non-U.S. deferred tax assets, including NOL carryforwards. 286 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K Unrecognized tax benefits At December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, JPMorgan Chase’s unrecognized tax benefits, excluding related interest expense and penalties, were $5.4 billion, $5.0 billion and $4.6 billion, respectively, of which $3.9 billion, $3.8 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively, if recognized, would reduce the annual effective tax rate. Included in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits are certain items that would not affect the effective tax rate if they were recognized in the Consolidated statements of income. These unrecognized items include the tax effect of certain temporary differences, the portion of gross state and local unrecognized tax benefits that would be offset by the benefit from associated U.S. federal income tax deductions, and the portion of gross non-U.S. unrecognized tax benefits that would have offsets in other jurisdictions. JPMorgan Chase evaluates the need for changes in unrecognized tax benefits based on its anticipated tax return filing positions as part of its U.S. federal and state and local tax returns. In addition, the Firm is presently under audit by a number of taxing authorities, most notably by the Internal Revenue Service, as summarized in the Tax examination status table below. The evaluation of unrecognized tax benefits as well as the potential for audit settlements make it reasonably possible that over the next 12 months the gross balance of unrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease by as much as approximately $1.1 billion. The change in the unrecognized tax benefit would result in a payment or income statement recognition. The following table presents a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits. Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2023 2022 2021 Balance at January 1, $ 5,043 $ 4,636 $ 4,250 Increases based on tax positions related to the current period 1,440 1,234 798 Increases based on tax positions related to prior periods 37 123 393 Decreases based on tax positions related to prior periods (1,110) (824) (657) Decreases related to cash settlements with taxing authorities (9) (126) (148) Balance at December 31, $ 5,401 $ 5,043 $ 4,636 After-tax interest expense/(benefit) and penalties related to income tax liabilities recognized in income tax expense were $229 million, $141 million and $174 million in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, in addition to the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, the Firm had accrued $1.6 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively, for income tax-related interest and penalties. Tax examination status JPMorgan Chase is continually under examination by the Internal Revenue Service, by taxing authorities throughout the world, and by many state and local jurisdictions throughout the U.S. The following table summarizes the status of tax years that remain subject to income tax examination of JPMorgan Chase and its consolidated subsidiaries by significant jurisdictions as of December 31, 2023. Periods under examination Status JPMorgan Chase – U.S. 2011 – 2013 Field examination of amended returns; certain matters at Appellate level JPMorgan Chase – U.S. 2014 - 2020 Field examination of original and amended returns; certain matters at Appellate level JPMorgan Chase – New York State 2012 - 2014 Field Examination JPMorgan Chase – New York City 2015 - 2017 Field Examination JPMorgan Chase – U.K. 2011 – 2020 Field examination of certain select entities JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K 287 Note 26 – Restricted cash, other restricted assets and intercompany funds transfers Restricted cash and other restricted assets Certain of the Firm’s cash and other assets are restricted as to withdrawal or usage. These restrictions are imposed by various regulatory authorities based on the particular activities of the Firm’s subsidiaries. The business of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is subject to examination and regulation by the OCC. The Bank is a member of the U.S. Federal Reserve System, and its deposits in the U.S. are insured by the FDIC, subject to applicable limits. The Firm is required to maintain cash reserves at certain non-US central banks. The Firm is also subject to rules and regulations established by other U.S. and non U.S. regulators. As part of its compliance with the respective regulatory requirements, the Firm’s broker-dealer activities are subject to certain restrictions on cash and other assets. The following table presents the components of the Firm’s restricted cash: December 31, (in billions) 2023 2022 Segregated for the benefit of securities and cleared derivative customers 10.3 18.7 Cash reserves at non-U.S. central banks and held for other general purposes 9.3 8.1 Total restricted cash(a) $ 19.6 $ 26.8 (a) Comprises $18.2 billion and $25.4 billion in deposits with banks, and $1.4 billion and $1.4 billion in cash and due from banks on the Consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Also, as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Firm had the following other restricted assets: • Cash and securities pledged with clearing organizations for the benefit of customers of $40.5 billion and $42.4 billion, respectively. • Securities with a fair value of $20.5 billion and $31.7 billion, respectively, were also restricted in relation to customer activity. Intercompany funds transfers Restrictions imposed by U.S. federal law prohibit JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., and its subsidiaries, from lending to JPMorgan Chase & Co. (“Parent Company”) and certain of its affiliates unless the loans are secured in specified amounts. Such secured loans provided by any banking subsidiary to the Parent Company or to any particular affiliate, together with certain other transactions with such affiliate (collectively referred to as “covered transactions”), must be made on terms and conditions that are consistent with safe and sound banking practices. In addition, unless collateralized with cash or US Government debt obligations, covered transactions are generally limited to 10% of the banking subsidiary’s total capital, as determined by the risk- based capital guidelines; the aggregate amount of covered transactions between any banking subsidiary and all of its affiliates is limited to 20% of the banking subsidiary’s total capital. The Parent Company’s two principal subsidiaries are JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and JPMorgan Chase Holdings LLC, an intermediate holding company (the “IHC”). The IHC generally holds the stock of JPMorgan Chase’s subsidiaries other than JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its subsidiaries. The IHC also owns other assets and provides intercompany loans to the Parent Company. The Parent Company is obligated to contribute to the IHC substantially all the net proceeds received from securities issuances (including issuances of senior and subordinated debt securities and of preferred and common stock). The principal sources of income and funding for the Parent Company are dividends from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and dividends and extensions of credit from the IHC. In addition to dividend restrictions set forth in statutes and regulations, the Federal Reserve, the OCC and the FDIC have authority under the Financial Institutions Supervisory Act to prohibit or to limit the payment of dividends by the banking organizations they supervise, including the Parent Company and its subsidiaries that are banks or bank holding companies, if, in the banking regulator’s opinion, payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the banking organization. The IHC is prohibited from paying dividends or extending credit to the Parent Company if certain capital or liquidity “thresholds” are breached or if limits are otherwise imposed by the Parent Company’s management or Board of Directors. At January 1, 2024, the Parent Company’s banking subsidiaries could pay, in the aggregate, approximately $20 billion in dividends to their respective bank holding companies without the prior approval of their relevant banking regulators. The capacity to pay dividends in 2024 will be supplemented by the banking subsidiaries’ earnings during the year. Notes to consolidated financial statements 288 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K Note 27 – Regulatory capital The Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements, including well-capitalized standards, for the Firm as a consolidated financial holding company. The OCC establishes similar minimum capital requirements and standards for the Firm’s principal IDI subsidiary, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The capital rules under Basel III establish minimum capital ratios and overall capital adequacy standards for large and internationally active U.S. bank holding companies and banks, including the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Two comprehensive approaches are prescribed for calculating RWA: a standardized approach (“Basel III Standardized”), and an advanced approach (“Basel III Advanced”). For each of the risk-based capital ratios, the capital adequacy of the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is evaluated against the lower of the Standardized or Advanced approaches compared to their respective regulatory capital ratio requirements. The three components of regulatory capital under the Basel III rules are as illustrated below: Under the risk-based capital and leverage-based guidelines of the Federal Reserve, JPMorgan Chase is required to maintain minimum ratios for CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital, Total capital, Tier 1 leverage and the SLR. Failure to meet these minimum requirements could cause the Federal Reserve to take action.

The contractual amount of these financial instruments represents the maximum possible credit risk to the Firm should the customer or client draw upon the commitment or the Firm be required to fulfill its obligation under the guarantee, and should the customer or client subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of the contract. Most of these commitments and guarantees have historically been refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired without being drawn or a default occurring. As a result, the total contractual amount of these instruments is not, in the Firm’s view, representative of its expected future credit exposure or funding requirements. To provide for expected credit losses in wholesale and certain consumer lending-related commitments, an allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments is maintained. Refer to Note 13 for further information regarding the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments. The following table summarizes the contractual amounts and carrying values of off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees and other commitments at December 31, 2023 and 2022. The amounts in the table below for credit card and home equity lending-related commitments represent the total available credit for these products. The Firm has not experienced, and does not anticipate, that all available lines of credit for these products will be utilized at the same time. The Firm can reduce or cancel credit card lines of credit by providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by law, without notice. In addition, the Firm typically closes credit card lines when the borrower is 60 days or more past due. The Firm may reduce or close HELOCs when there are significant decreases in the value of the underlying property, or when there has been a demonstrable decline in the creditworthiness of the borrower.

The Firm also issues commitments under multipurpose facilities which could be drawn upon in several forms, including the issuance of a standby letter of credit. Guarantees U.S. GAAP requires that a guarantor recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability in an amount equal to the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. U.S. GAAP defines a guarantee as a contract that contingently requires the guarantor to pa y the guaranteed party based upon: (a) changes in an underlying asset, liability or equity security of the guaranteed party; or (b) a third party’s failure to perform under a specified agreement. The Firm considers the following off–balance sheet arrangements to be guarantees under U.S. GAAP: standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees, securities lending indemnifications, certain indemnification agreements included within third-party contractual arrangements, certain derivative contracts and the guarantees under the sponsored member repo program. As required by U.S. GAAP, the Firm initially records guarantees at the inception date fair value of the non- contingent obligation assumed (e.g., the amount of consideration received or the net present value of the premium receivable). For these obligations, the Firm records this fair value amount in other liabilities with an offsetting entry recorded in cash (for premiums received), or other assets (for premiums receivable). Any premium receivable recorded in other assets is reduced as cash is received under the contract, and the fair value of the liability recorded at inception is amortized into income as lending and deposit-related fees over the life of the guarantee contract. The lending-related contingent obligation is recognized based on expected credit losses in addition to, and separate from, any non-contingent obligation. Non-lending-related contingent obligations are recognized when the liability becomes probable and reasonably estimable. These obligations are not recognized if the estimated amount is less than the carrying amount of any non-contingent liability recognized at inception (adjusted for any amortization). Examples of non-lending-related contingent obligations include indemnifications provided in sales agreements, where a portion of the sale proceeds is allocated to the guarantee, which adjusts the gain or loss that would otherwise result from the transaction. For these indemnifications, the initial liability is amortized to income as the Firm’s risk is reduced (i.e., over time or when the indemnification expires). The contractual amount and carrying value of guarantees and indemnifications are included in the table on page 292. For additional information on the guarantees, see below. Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees are conditional lending commitments issued by the Firm to guarantee the performance of a client or customer to a third party under certain arrangements, such as commercial paper facilities, bond financings, acquisition financings, trade financings and similar transactions. The following table summarizes the contractual amount and carrying value of standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees and other letters of credit arrangements as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.

Refer to Note 12 for further information on internal risk ratings. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K 293 2023 2022 Securities lending indemnifications Through the Firm’s securities lending program, counterparties’ securities, via custodial and non-custodial arrangements, may be lent to third parties. As part of this program, the Firm provides an indemnification in the lending agreements which protects the lender against the failure of the borrower to return the lent securities. To minimize its liability under these indemnification agreements, the Firm obtains cash or other highly liquid collateral with a market value exceeding 100% of the value of the securities on loan from the borrower. Collateral is marked to market daily to help assure that collateralization is adequate. Additional collateral is called from the borrower if a shortfall exists, or collateral may be released to the borrower in the event of overcollateralization. If a borrower defaults, the Firm would use the collateral held to purchase replacement securities in the market or to credit the lending client or counterparty with the cash equivalent thereof. The cash collateral held by the Firm may be invested on behalf of the client in indemnified resale agreements, whereby the Firm indemnifies the client against the loss of principal invested. To minimize its liability under these agreements, the Firm obtains collateral with a market value exceeding 100% of the principal invested. Derivatives qualifying as guarantees The Firm transacts in certain derivative contracts that have the characteristics of a guarantee under U.S. GAAP. These contracts include written put options that require the Firm to purchase assets upon exercise by the option holder at a specified price by a specified date in the future. The Firm may enter into written put option contracts in order to meet client needs, or for other trading purposes. The terms of written put options are typically five years or less. Derivatives deemed to be guarantees also includes stable value contracts, commonly referred to as “stable value products”, that require the Firm to make a payment of the difference between the market value and the book value of a counterparty’s reference portfolio of assets in the event that market value is less than book value and certain other conditions have been met. Stable value products are transacted in order to allow investors to realize investment returns with less volatility than an unprotected portfolio. These contracts are typically longer-term or may have no stated maturity, but allow the Firm to elect to terminate the contract under certain conditions. The notional value of derivative guarantees generally represents the Firm’s maximum exposure. However, exposure to certain stable value products is contractually limited to a substantially lower percentage of the notional amount. The fair value of derivative guarantees reflects the probability, in the Firm’s view, of whether the Firm will be required to perform under the contract. The Firm reduces exposures to these contracts by entering into offsetting transactions, or by entering into contracts that hedge the market risk related to the derivative guarantees. The following table summarizes the derivatives qualifying as guarantees as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. (in millions) December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 Notional amounts Derivative guarantees $ 54,562 $ 59,180 Stable value contracts with contractually limited exposure 32,488 31,820 Maximum exposure of stable value contracts with contractually limited exposure 1,652 2,063 Fair value Derivative payables 89 649 In addition to derivative contracts that meet the characteristics of a guarantee, the Firm is both a purchaser and seller of credit protection in the credit derivatives market. Refer to Note 5 for a further discussion of credit derivatives. Unsettled securities financing agreements In the normal course of business, the Firm enters into resale and securities borrowed agreements. At settlement, these commitments result in the Firm advancing cash to and receiving securities collateral from the counterparty. The Firm also enters into repurchase and securities loaned agreements. At settlement, these commitments result in the Firm receiving cash from and providing securities collateral to the counterparty. Such agreements settle at a future date. These agreements generally do not meet the definition of a derivative, and therefore, are not recorded on the Consolidated balance sheets until settlement date. These agreements predominantly have regular-way settlement terms. Refer to Note 11 for a further discussion of securities financing agreements. Loan sales- and securitization-related indemnifications Mortgage repurchase liability In connection with the Firm’s mortgage loan sale and securitization activities with U.S. GSEs the Firm has made representations and warranties that the loans sold meet certain requirements, and that may require the Firm to repurchase mortgage loans and/or indemnify the loan purchaser if such representations and warranties are breached by the Firm. Private label securitizations The liability related to repurchase demands associated with private label securitizations is separately evaluated by the Firm in establishing its litigation reserves. Refer to Note 30 for additional information regarding litigation. Loans sold with recourse The Firm provides servicing for mortgages and certain commercial lending products on both a recourse and nonrecourse basis. In nonrecourse servicing, the principal credit risk to the Firm is the cost of temporary servicing advances of funds (i.e., normal servicing advances). In recourse servicing, the servicer agrees to share credit risk with the owner of the mortgage loans, such as Fannie Mae Notes to consolidated financial statements 294 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K or Freddie Mac or a private investor, insurer or guarantor. Losses on recourse servicing predominantly occur when foreclosure sales proceeds of the property underlying a defaulted loan are less than the sum of the outstanding principal balance, plus accrued interest on the loan and the cost of holding and disposing of the underlying property. The Firm’s securitizations are predominantly nonrecourse, thereby effectively transferring the risk of future credit losses to the purchaser of the mortgage-backed securities issued by the trust. The unpaid principal balance of loans sold with recourse as well as the carrying value of the related liability that the Firm has recorded in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets, which is representative of the Firm’s view of the likelihood it will have to perform under its recourse obligations, are disclosed in the table on page 292. Other off-balance sheet arrangements Indemnification agreements – general In connection with issuing securities to investors outside the U.S., the Firm may agree to pay additional amounts to the holders of the securities in the event that, due to a change in tax law, certain types of withholding taxes are imposed on payments on the securities. The terms of the securities may also give the Firm the right to redeem the securities if such additional amounts are payable. The Firm may also enter into indemnification clauses in connection with the licensing of software to clients (“software licensees”) or when it sells a business or assets to a third party (“third- party purchasers”), pursuant to which it indemnifies software licensees for claims of liability or damages that may occur subsequent to the licensing of the software, or third-party purchasers for losses they may incur due to actions taken by the Firm prior to the sale of the business or assets. It is difficult to estimate the Firm’s maximum exposure under these indemnification arrangements, since this would require an assessment of future changes in tax law and future claims that may be made against the Firm that have not yet occurred. However, based on historical experience, management expects the risk of loss to be remote. Merchant charge-backs Under the rules of payment networks, in its role as a merchant acquirer, the Firm’s Merchant Services business in CIB Payments, retains a contingent liability for disputed processed credit and debit card transactions that result in a charge-back to the merchant. If a dispute is resolved in the cardholder’s favor, the Firm will (through the cardholder’s issuing bank) credit or refund the amount to the cardholder and will charge back the transaction to the merchant. If the Firm is unable to collect the amount from the merchant, the Firm will bear the loss for the amount credited or refunded to the cardholder. The Firm mitigates this risk by withholding future settlements, retaining cash reserve accounts or obtaining other collateral. In addition, the Firm recognizes a valuation allowance that covers the payment or performance risk related to charge-backs. For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Firm processed an aggregate volume of $2,411.0 billion, $2,158.4 billion, and $1,886.7 billion, respectively. Clearing Services – Client Credit Risk The Firm provides clearing services for clients by entering into securities purchases and sales and derivative contracts with CCPs, including ETDs such as futures and options, as well as OTC-cleared derivative contracts. As a clearing member, the Firm stands behind the performance of its clients, collects cash and securities collateral (margin) as well as any settlement amounts due from or to clients, and remits them to the relevant CCP or client in whole or part. There are two types of margin: variation margin is posted on a daily basis based on the value of clients’ derivative contracts and initial margin is posted at inception of a derivative contract, generally on the basis of the potential changes in the variation margin requirement for the contract. As a clearing member, the Firm is exposed to the risk of nonperformance by its clients, but is not liable to clients for the performance of the CCPs. Where possible, the Firm seeks to mitigate its risk to the client through the collection of appropriate amounts of margin at inception and throughout the life of the transactions. The Firm can also cease providing clearing services if clients do not adhere to their obligations under the clearing agreement. In the event of nonperformance by a client, the Firm would close out the client’s positions and access available margin. The CCP would utilize any margin it holds to make itself whole, with any remaining shortfalls required to be paid by the Firm as a clearing member. The Firm reflects its exposure to nonperformance risk of the client through the recognition of margin receivables from clients and margin payables to CCPs; the clients’ underlying securities or derivative contracts are not reflected in the Firm’s Consolidated Financial Statements. It is difficult to estimate the Firm’s maximum possible exposure through its role as a clearing member, as this would require an assessment of transactions that clients may execute in the future. However, based upon historical experience, and the credit risk mitigants available to the Firm, management believes it is unlikely that the Firm will have to make any material payments under these arrangements and the risk of loss is expected to be remote. Refer to Note 5 for information on the derivatives that the Firm executes for its own account and records in its Consolidated Financial Statements. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K 295 Exchange & Clearing House Memberships The Firm is a member of several securities and derivative exchanges and clearing houses, both in the U.S. and other countries, and it provides clearing services to its clients. Membership in some of these organizations requires the Firm to pay a pro rata share of the losses incurred by the organization as a result of the default of another member. Such obligations vary with different organizations. These obligations may be limited to the amount (or a multiple of the amount) of the Firm’s contribution to the guarantee fund maintained by a clearing house or exchange as part of the resources available to cover any losses in the event of a member default. Alternatively, these obligations may also include a pro rata share of the residual losses after applying the guarantee fund. Additionally, certain clearing houses require the Firm as a member to pay a pro rata share of losses that may result from the clearing house’s investment of guarantee fund contributions and initial margin, unrelated to and independent of the default of another member. Generally a payment would only be required should such losses exceed the resources of the clearing house or exchange that are contractually required to absorb the losses in the first instance. In certain cases, it is difficult to estimate the Firm’s maximum possible exposure under these membership agreements, since this would require an assessment of future claims that may be made against the Firm that have not yet occurred. However, based on historical experience, management expects the risk of loss to the Firm to be remote. Where the Firm’s maximum possible exposure can be estimated, the amount is disclosed in the table on page 292, in the Exchange & clearing house guarantees and commitments line. Sponsored member repo program The Firm acts as a sponsoring member to clear eligible overnight and term resale and repurchase agreements through the Government Securities Division of the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (“FICC”) on behalf of clients that become sponsored members under the FICC’s rules. The Firm also guarantees to the FICC the prompt and full payment and performance of its sponsored member clients’ respective obligations under the FICC’s rules. The Firm minimizes its liability under these guarantees by obtaining a security interest in the cash or high-quality securities collateral that the clients place with the clearing house; therefore, the Firm expects the risk of loss to be remote. The Firm’s maximum possible exposure, without taking into consideration the associated collateral, is included in the Exchange & clearing house guarantees and commitments line on page 292. Refer to Note 11 for additional information on credit risk mitigation practices on resale agreements and the types of collateral pledged under repurchase agreements. Guarantees of subsidiaries In the normal course of business, the Parent Company may provide counterparties with guarantees of certain of the trading and other obligations of its subsidiaries on a contract-by-contract basis, as negotiated with the Firm’s counterparties. The obligations of the subsidiaries are included on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets or are reflected as off-balance sheet commitments; therefore, the Parent Company has not recognized a separate liability for these guarantees. The Firm believes that the occurrence of any event that would trigger payments by the Parent Company under these guarantees is remote. The Parent Company has guaranteed certain long-term debt and structured notes of its subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase Financial Company LLC (“JPMFC”), a 100%-owned finance subsidiary. All securities issued by JPMFC are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Parent Company and no other subsidiary of the parent company guarantees these securities. These guarantees, which rank pari passu with the Firm’s unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness, are not included in the table on page 292 of this Note. Refer to Note 20 for additional information. Notes to consolidated financial statements 296 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K Note 29 – Pledged assets and collateral Pledged assets The Firm pledges financial assets that it owns to maintain potential borrowing capacity at discount windows with Federal Reserve banks, various other central banks and FHLBs. Additionally, the Firm pledges assets for other purposes, including to collateralize repurchase and other securities financing agreements, to cover short sales and to collateralize derivative contracts and deposits. Certain of these pledged assets may be sold or repledged or otherwise used by the secured parties and are parenthetically identified on the Consolidated balance sheets as assets pledged. The following table presents the Firm’s pledged assets. December 31, (in billions) 2023 2022 Assets that may be sold or repledged or otherwise used by secured parties $ 145.0 $ 110.8 Assets that may not be sold or repledged or otherwise used by secured parties (a) 244.2 114.8 Assets pledged at Federal Reserve banks and FHLBs 675.6 567.6 Total pledged assets $ 1,064.8 $ 793.2 (a) As of December 31, 2023, included $88.4 billion of assets pledged to the FDIC associated with the First Republic acquisition. Refer to Note 34 for additional information. Total pledged assets do not include assets of consolidated VIEs; these assets are used to settle the liabilities of those entities. Refer to Note 14 for additional information on assets and liabilities of consolidated VIEs. Refer to Note 11 for additional information on the Firm’s securities financing activities. Refer to Note 20 for additional information on the Firm’s long-term debt. The significant components of the Firm’s pledged assets were as follows. December 31, (in billions) 2023 2022 Investment securities $ 108.6 $ 104.4 Loans 681.7 485.9 Trading assets and other 274.5 202.9 Total pledged assets $ 1,064.8 $ 793.2 Collateral The Firm accepts financial assets as collateral that it is permitted to sell or repledge, deliver or otherwise use. This collateral is generally obtained under resale and other securities financing agreements, prime brokerage-related held-for-investment customer receivables and derivative contracts. Collateral is generally used under repurchase and other securities financing agreements, to cover short sales, and to collateralize derivative contracts and deposits. The following table presents the fair value of collateral accepted. December 31, (in billions) 2023 2022 Collateral permitted to be sold or repledged, delivered, or otherwise used $ 1,303.9 $ 1,346.9 Collateral sold, repledged, delivered or otherwise used 982.8 1,019.4 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K 297 Note 30 – Litigation Contingencies As of December 31, 2023, the Firm and its subsidiaries and affiliates are defendants or respondents in numerous evolving legal proceedings, including private proceedings, public proceedings, government investigations, regulatory enforcement matters, and the matters described below. The litigations range from individual actions involving a single plaintiff to class action lawsuits with potentially millions of class members. Investigations and regulatory enforcement matters involve both formal and informal proceedings, by both governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations. These legal proceedings are at varying stages of adjudication, arbitration or investigation, and involve each of the Firm’s lines of business and several geographies and a wide variety of claims (including common law tort and contract claims and statutory antitrust, securities and consumer protection claims), some of which present novel legal theories. The Firm believes the estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses, in excess of reserves established, for its legal proceedings is from $0 to approximately $1.3 billion at December 31, 2023. This estimated aggregate range of reasonably possible losses was based upon information available as of that date for those proceedings in which the Firm believes that an estimate of reasonably possible loss can be made. For certain matters, the Firm does not believe that such an estimate can be made, as of that date. The Firm’s estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses involves significant judgment, given: • the number, variety and varying stages of the proceedings, including the fact that many are in preliminary stages, • the existence in many such proceedings of multiple defendants, including the Firm, whose share of liability (if any) has yet to be determined, • the numerous yet-unresolved issues in many of the proceedings, including issues regarding class certification and the scope of many of the claims, and • the uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of such proceedings, including where the Firm has made assumptions concerning future rulings by the court or other adjudicator, or about the behavior or incentives of adverse parties or regulatory authorities, and those assumptions prove to be incorrect. In addition, the outcome of a particular proceeding may be a result which the Firm did not take into account in its estimate because the Firm had deemed the likelihood of that outcome to be remote. Accordingly, the Firm’s estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses will change from time to time, and actual losses may vary significantly. Set forth below are descriptions of the Firm’s material legal proceedings. 1MDB Litigation. J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA was named as a defendant in a civil litigation filed in May 2021 in Malaysia by 1Malaysia Development Berhad (“1MDB”), a Malaysian state-owned and controlled investment fund. The claim alleges “dishonest assistance” against J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA in relation to payments of $300 million and $500 million, from 2009 and 2010, respectively, received from 1MDB and paid into an account at J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA held by 1MDB PetroSaudi Limited, a joint venture company between 1MDB and PetroSaudi Holdings (Cayman) Limited. The Firm is challenging the validity of service and the Malaysian Court’s jurisdiction to hear the claim. In August 2023 the Court denied an application by 1MDB to discontinue its claim with permission to re-file a new claim in the future. An appeals court is scheduled in August 2024 to hear separate appeals filed by 1MDB and the Firm against that August 2023 decision. In its appeal, the Firm seeks to prevent any claim from continuing. In addition, in November 2023, the Federal Office of the Attorney General (OAG) in Switzerland notified J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA that it is conducting an investigation into possible criminal liability in connection with transactions arising from J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA’s relationship with the 1MDB PetroSaudi joint venture and its related persons for the period September 2009 through August 2015. The OAG investigation is ongoing. Amrapali. India’s Enforcement Directorate (“ED”) is investigating J.P. Morgan India Private Limited in connection with investments made in 2010 and 2012 by two offshore funds formerly managed by JPMorgan Chase entities into residential housing projects developed by the Amrapali Group (“Amrapali”) relating to delays in delivering or failure to deliver residential units. In August 2021, the ED issued an order fining J.P. Morgan India Private Limited approximately $31.5 million, and the Firm is appealing that order. Relatedly, in July 2019, the Supreme Court of India issued an order making preliminary findings that Amrapali and other parties, including unspecified JPMorgan Chase entities and the offshore funds that had invested in the projects, violated certain criminal currency control and money laundering provisions, and ordered the ED to conduct a further inquiry. The Firm is responding to and cooperating with the inquiry. Foreign Exchange Investigations and Litigation. The Firm previously reported settlements with certain government authorities relating to its foreign exchange (“FX”) sales and trading activities and controls related to those activities. Among those resolutions, in May 2015, the Firm pleaded guilty to a single violation of federal antitrust law. The Department of Labor (\"DOL\") granted the Firm exemptions that permit the Firm and its affiliates to continue to rely on the Qualified Professional Asset Manager exemption under Notes to consolidated financial statements 298 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”) through the ten-year disqualification period following the antitrust plea. The only remaining FX-related governmental inquiry is a South Africa Competition Commission matter which is currently pending before the South Africa Competition Tribunal. With respect to civil litigation matters, in a putative class action filed against the Firm and other foreign exchange dealers on behalf of certain parties who purchased foreign currencies at allegedly inflated rates, the District Court denied certification of a class and granted summary judgment against the named plaintiffs in March 2023. An appeal by those plaintiffs of the District Court's decision is pending. In addition, some FX-related individual and putative class actions based on similar alleged underlying conduct have been filed outside the U.S., including in the U.K., Israel, the Netherlands, Brazil and Australia. An agreement to resolve one of the U.K. actions was reached in December 2022. In July 2023, the U.K. Court of Appeal overturned the Competition Appeal Tribunal's earlier denial of a request for class certification on an opt-out basis. In Israel, a settlement in principle has been reached on the putative class action, which remains subject to court approval. Government Inquiries Related to the Zelle Network. The Firm is responding to inquiries from civil government authorities regarding the handling of disputes related to transfers of funds through the Zelle Network. The Firm is cooperating with these inquiries and responding to requests for information. Interchange Litigation. Groups of merchants and retail associations filed a series of class action complaints alleging that Visa and Mastercard, as well as certain banks, conspired to set the price of credit and debit card interchange fees and enacted related rules in violation of antitrust laws. In September 2018, the parties settled the class action seeking monetary relief, with the defendants collectively contributing approximately $6.2 billion. The settlement has been approved by the District Court and affirmed on appeal. Based on the percentage of merchants that opted out of the settlement, $700 million has been returned to the defendants from the settlement escrow. A separate class action seeking injunctive relief continues, and in September 2021, the District Court granted plaintiffs’ motion for class certification in part, and denied the motion in part. Of the merchants who opted out of the damages class settlement, certain merchants filed individual actions raising similar allegations against Visa and Mastercard, as well as against the Firm and other banks. While some of those actions remain pending, the defendants have reached settlements with the merchants who opted out representing approximately 70% of the combined Mastercard-branded and Visa-branded payment card sales volume. Jeffrey Epstein Litigation. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. was named as a defendant in lawsuits filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging that JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. knowingly facilitated Jeffrey Epstein’s sex trafficking and other unlawful conduct by providing banking services to Epstein until 2013. In June 2023, the Court granted preliminary approval of a settlement between the victim class and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., pursuant to which JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. paid $290 million to a fund for Epstein survivors. In November 2023, the Court granted final approval of the settlement, rejecting objections, including those of certain state Attorneys General, regarding the victims’ releases. LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rate Investigations and Litigation. JPMorgan Chase has responded to inquiries from various governmental agencies and entities around the world relating primarily to the British Bankers Association’s (“BBA”) London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) for various currencies and the European Banking Federation’s Euro Interbank Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”). The Swiss Competition Commission’s investigation relating to EURIBOR, to which the Firm and one other bank remain subject, continues. The Firm appealed a December 2016 decision by the European Commission against the Firm and other banks finding an infringement of European antitrust rules relating to EURIBOR. In December 2023, the European General Court annulled the fine imposed by the European Commission, but exercised its discretion to re-impose a fine in an identical amount. The Firm is considering its options. In addition, the Firm has been named as a defendant along with other banks in various individual and putative class actions related to benchmark rates, including U.S. dollar LIBOR. In actions related to U.S. dollar LIBOR during the period that it was administered by the BBA, the Firm has obtained dismissal of certain actions and resolved certain other actions, and others are in various stages of litigation. The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York has granted class certification of antitrust claims related to bonds and interest rate swaps sold directly by the defendants, including the Firm. In addition, a lawsuit filed by a group of individual plaintiffs asserting antitrust claims, alleging that the Firm and other defendants were engaged in an unlawful agreement to set U.S. dollar LIBOR and conspired to monopolize the market for LIBOR-based consumer loans and credit cards was dismissed in October 2023. Plaintiff filed an appeal of the dismissal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in November 2023. The Firm has resolved all non-U.S. dollar LIBOR actions. Russian Litigation. The Firm is obligated to comply with international sanctions laws, which mandate the freezing or restriction of certain assets. These laws apply when assets associated with individuals, companies, products or services are within the scope of the sanctions. The Firm has faced actual and threatened litigation in Russia seeking payments on transactions that the Firm cannot make, and is contractually excused from paying, under relevant sanctions laws, with judgment entered against the Firm in one claim in February 2024. The Russian court may JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K 299 disregard the parties’ contractual agreement on forum selection, and may not recognize foreign sanctions laws as a basis for not making payment. The Firm holds assets in Russia, which could be seized if the claims are granted and enforced. SEC Inquiries. The Firm is responding to requests from the SEC regarding aspects of certain advisory programs within J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, including aggregation of accounts for billing, discounting advisory fees, and selecting portfolio managers. Separately, the Firm is responding to requests from the SEC in connection with the timing of the Firm’s liquidation of shares distributed in-kind to certain investment vehicles that invest in third-party managed private funds. The Firm is cooperating with the SEC in regard to both inquires. Securities Lending Antitrust Litigation. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, J.P. Morgan Prime, Inc., and J.P. Morgan Strategic Securities Lending Corp. are named as defendants in a putative class action filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The complaint asserts violations of federal antitrust law and New York State common law in connection with an alleged conspiracy to prevent the emergence of anonymous exchange trading for securities lending transactions. The settlement of this action by the parties has been preliminarily approved, and is subject to final court approval. Shareholder Litigation. Several shareholder putative class actions, as well as shareholder derivative actions purporting to act on behalf of the Firm, have been filed against the Firm, its Board of Directors and certain of its current and former officers. Certain of these shareholder suits relate to historical trading practices by former employees in the precious metals and U.S. treasuries markets and related conduct which were the subject of the Firm’s resolutions with the DOJ, CFTC and SEC in September 2020, and fiduciary activities that were separately the subject of a resolution between JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the OCC in November 2020. One of these shareholder derivative suits was filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York in May 2022, asserting breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment claims relating to the historical trading practices and related conduct and fiduciary activities which were the subject of the resolutions described above. In December 2022, the court granted defendants’ motion to dismiss this action in full, and in July 2023, the plaintiff filed an appeal, which remains pending. A second shareholder derivative action was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York in December 2022 relating to the historical trading practices and related conduct, which asserts breach of fiduciary duty and contribution claims and alleges that the shareholder is excused from making a demand to commence litigation because such a demand would have been futile. Defendants have moved to dismiss the complaint. In addition, a consolidated putative class action is pending in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York on behalf of shareholders who acquired shares of JPMorgan Chase common stock during the putative class period, alleging that certain SEC filings of the Firm were materially false or misleading because they did not disclose certain information relating to the historical trading practices and conduct. In December 2023, the court granted Defendants’ motion to dismiss the amended complaint. A shareholder derivative suit was filed in May 2023 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against various officers and directors of the Firm asserting breaches of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment based upon allegations that the defendants caused the Firm to retain Jeffrey Epstein as a client of the bank after defendants knew, or should have known, that Epstein was using the Firm’s financial services to facilitate his alleged sex trafficking activities. In December 2023, the Court dismissed the derivative action. A separate shareholder derivative suit was filed in March 2022 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York asserting breaches of fiduciary duty and violations of federal securities laws based on the alleged failure of the Board of Directors to exercise adequate oversight over the Firm’s compliance with records preservation requirements which were the subject of resolutions between certain of the Firm’s subsidiaries and the SEC and the CFTC. Defendants’ motion to dismiss the amended complaint is pending. Trading Venues Investigations. The Firm has been responding to government inquiries regarding its processes to inventory trading venues and confirm the completeness of certain data fed to trade surveillance platforms. The Firm self-identified that certain trading and order data through the CIB was not feeding into its trade surveillance platforms. The Firm has completed enhancements to the CIB’s venue inventory and data completeness controls, and other remediation is underway. The Firm has also performed a review of the data not originally surveilled, which is nearly complete, and has not identified any employee misconduct, harm to clients or the market. While the identified gaps represent a fraction of the overall activity across the CIB, the data gap on one venue, which largely consisted of sponsored client access activity, was significant. The Firm is dedicated to maintaining rigorous controls and continuously enhancing the reliability of its trade infrastructure. The Firm expects to enter into resolutions with two U.S. regulators that will require the Firm to, among other things, complete its remediation, engage an independent consultant, and pay aggregate civil penalties of approximately $350 million. The Firm is also in advanced negotiations with a third U.S. regulator, but there is no assurance that such discussions will result in a resolution. The Firm does not expect any disruption of service to clients as a result of these resolutions. * * * Notes to consolidated financial statements 300 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K In addition to the various legal proceedings discussed above, JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries are named as defendants or are otherwise involved in a substantial number of other legal proceedings. The Firm believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it in its currently outstanding legal proceedings and it intends to defend itself vigorously. Additional legal proceedings may be initiated from time to time in the future. The Firm has established reserves for several hundred of its currently outstanding legal proceedings. In accordance with the provisions of U.S. GAAP for contingencies, the Firm accrues for a litigation-related liability when it is probable that such a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Firm evaluates its outstanding legal proceedings each quarter to assess its litigation reserves, and makes adjustments in such reserves, upward or downward, as appropriate, based on management’s best judgment after consultation with counsel. The Firm’s legal expense was $1.4 billion, $266 million and $426 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. There is no assurance that the Firm’s litigation reserves will not need to be adjusted in the future. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of legal proceedings, particularly where the claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages, or where the matters present novel legal theories, involve a large number of parties or are in early stages of discovery, the Firm cannot state with confidence what will be the eventual outcomes of the currently pending matters, the timing of their ultimate resolution or the eventual losses, fines, penalties or consequences related to those matters. JPMorgan Chase believes, based upon its current knowledge and after consultation with counsel, consideration of the material legal proceedings described above and after taking into account its current litigation reserves and its estimated aggregate range of possible losses, that the other legal proceedings currently pending against it should not have a material adverse effect on the Firm’s consolidated financial condition. The Firm notes, however, that in light of the uncertainties involved in such proceedings, there is no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not significantly exceed the reserves it has currently accrued or that a matter will not have material reputational consequences. As a result, the outcome of a particular matter may be material to JPMorgan Chase’s operating results for a particular period, depending on, among other factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level of JPMorgan Chase’s income for that period. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K 301 Note 31 – International operations The following table presents income statement and balance sheet-related information for JPMorgan Chase by major international geographic area. The Firm defines international activities for purposes of this footnote presentation as business transactions that involve clients residing outside of the U.S., and the information presented below is based predominantly on the domicile of the client, the location from which the client relationship is managed, booking location or the location of the trading desk. However, many of the Firm’s U.S. operations serve international businesses. As the Firm’s operations are highly integrated, estimates and subjective assumptions have been made to apportion revenue and expense between U.S. and international operations. These estimates and assumptions are consistent with the allocations used for the Firm’s segment reporting as set forth in Note 32. The Firm’s long-lived assets for the periods presented are not considered by management to be significant in relation to total assets. The majority of the Firm’s long-lived assets are located in the U.S. As of or for the year ended December 31, (in millions) Revenue(c) Expense(d) Income before income tax expense Net income Total assets 2023 Europe/Middle East/Africa $ 20,974 $ 11,947 $ 9,027 $ 6,402 $ 529,335 (e) Asia-Pacific 10,605 6,550 4,055 2,709 251,588 Latin America/Caribbean 3,294 1,971 1,323 994 83,003 Total international 34,873 20,468 14,405 10,105 863,926 North America(a)(b) 123,231 76,024 47,207 39,447 3,011,467 Total $ 158,104 $ 96,492 $ 61,612 $ 49,552 $ 3,875,393 2022 Europe/Middle East/Africa $ 18,765 $ 11,754 $ 7,011 $ 5,158 $ 558,430 (e) Asia-Pacific 10,025 6,763 3,262 2,119 281,479 Latin America/Caribbean 3,178 1,697 1,481 1,156 78,673 Total international 31,968 20,214 11,754 8,433 918,582 North America(a) 96,727 62,315 34,412 29,243 2,747,161 Total $ 128,695 $ 82,529 $ 46,166 $ 37,676 $ 3,665,743 2021 Europe/Middle East/Africa $ 16,561 $ 10,833 $ 5,728 $ 4,202 $ 517,904 (e) Asia-Pacific 9,654 6,372 3,282 2,300 277,897 Latin America/Caribbean 2,756 1,589 1,167 878 65,040 Total international 28,971 18,794 10,177 7,380 860,841 North America(a) 92,678 43,293 49,385 40,954 2,882,726 Total $ 121,649 $ 62,087 $ 59,562 $ 48,334 $ 3,743,567 (a) Substantially reflects the U.S. (b) Includes the impact of First Republic.

There are four major reportable business segments – Consumer & Community Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank, Commercial Banking and Asset & Wealth Management. In addition, there is a Corporate segment. The business segments are determined based on the products and services provided, or the type of customer served, and they reflect the manner in which financial information is evaluated by the Firm’s Operating Committee. Segment results are presented on a managed basis. Refer to Segment results of this footnote for a further discussion of JPMorgan Chase’s business segments. The following is a description of each of the Firm’s business segments, and the products and services they provide to their respective client bases.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K 303 Segment results The following table provides a summary of the Firm’s segment results as of or for the years ended December 31, 2023 , 2022 and 2021, on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the reportable business segments) on an FTE basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. This allows management to assess the comparability of revenue from year-to-year arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense/(benefit). These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the LOBs. Capital allocation Each business segment is allocated capital by taking into consideration a variety of factors including capital levels of similarly rated peers and applicable regulatory capital requirements. ROE is measured and internal targets for expected returns are established as key measures of a business segment’s performance. The Firm’s current allocation methodology incorporates Basel III Standardized RWA and the GSIB surcharge, both under rules currently in effect, as well as a simulation of capital in a severe stress environment. At least annually, the assumptions, judgments and methodologies used to allocate capital are reassessed and, as a result, the capital allocated to the LOBs may change.

Notes to consolidated financial statements 306 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K Note 34 – Business combinations On May 1, 2023, JPMorgan Chase acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of First Republic Bank (the \"First Republic acquisition\") from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”), as receiver. The Firm believes that the First Republic acquisition is complementary to the Firm's existing franchises. The acquisition resulted in an estimated bargain purchase gain, which represents the excess of the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired above the purchase price. The Firm has determined that this acquisition constitutes a business combination under U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, the initial recognition of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were generally measured at their estimated fair values as of May 1, 2023. The determination of those fair values required management to make certain market-based assumptions about expected future cash flows, discount rates and other valuation inputs at the time of the acquisition. The Firm believes that the fair value estimates of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed provide a reasonable basis for determining the estimated bargain purchase gain. The Firm and the FDIC have not yet completed the settlement process under which the purchase price, and the identification of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, will be finalized. The finalization of this settlement process may impact the amount of the estimated bargain purchase gain. The purchase and assumption agreement entered into with the FDIC allows for final settlement to occur up to a year after the acquisition date. In addition, the purchase price and the estimated bargain purchase gain could change pending management's finalization of its acquisition date fair value estimates for certain of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, which may take place up to one year from the acquisition date, as permitted by U.S. GAAP. The First Republic acquisition resulted in a preliminary estimated bargain purchase gain of $2.7 billion. The Firm has continued to progress in the settlement process with the FDIC and refine its acquisition-date fair value estimates. As a result, during the year ended December 31, 2023, adjustments totaling $63 million were made, increasing the estimated bargain purchase gain to $2.8 billion. In connection with the First Republic acquisition, the Firm and the FDIC entered into two shared-loss agreements with respect to certain loans and lending-related commitments (the \"shared-loss assets\"): the Commercial Shared-Loss Agreement (\"CSLA\") and the Single-Family Shared-Loss Agreement (“SFSLA”). The CSLA covers 80% of credit losses, on a pari passu basis, over 5 years with a subsequent 3-year recovery period for certain acquired commercial loans and other real estate exposure. The SFSLA covers 80% of credit losses, on a pari passu basis, for 7 years for certain acquired loans secured by mortgages on real property or shares in cooperative property constituting a primary residence. The indemnification assets, which represent the fair value of the CSLA and SFSLA on the acquisition date, are reflected in the total assets acquired. As part of the consideration paid, JPMorgan Chase issued a five-year, $50 billion secured note to the FDIC (the \"Purchase Money Note\"). The Purchase Money Note bears interest at a fixed rate of 3.4% and is secured by certain of the acquired loans. The Purchase Money Note is prepayable upon notice to the holder. The Firm had placed a $5 billion deposit with First Republic Bank on March 16, 2023, as part of $30 billion of deposits provided by a consortium of large U.S. banks. The Firm's $5 billion deposit was effectively settled as part of the acquisition and the associated allowance for credit losses was released upon closing. The Firm subsequently repaid the remaining $25 billion of deposits to the consortium of banks, including accrued interest through the payment date on May 9, 2023. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K 307 The computation of the purchase price, the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as part of the First Republic acquisition and the related estimated bargain purchase gain are presented below, and reflect the adjustments made through December 31, 2023 to the acquisition-date fair value of the net assets acquired.

(b) Includes $447 million of securities financing transactions with First Republic Bank that were effectively settled on the acquisition date. (c) In the fourth quarter, certain assets and liabilities were reclassified resulting in a $762 million increase to loans, an $870 million decrease to accounts receivable and other assets and a $30 million increase to accounts payable and other liabilities. (d) Other assets include $1.2 billion in tax-oriented investments and $683 million of lease right-of-use assets. Other liabilities include the related tax-oriented investment liabilities of $669 million and lease liabilities of $748 million. Refer to Note 14 and Note 18 for additional information. The issuance of the $50 billion Purchase Money Note, the effective settlement of the Firm's $5 billion deposit and $447 million of securities financing with First Republic Bank, and the $3.6 billion payable to the FDIC as part of the purchase price consideration are considered non-cash transactions. The following describes the accounting policies and fair value methodologies generally used by the Firm for the following assets acquired and liabilities assumed: core deposit and customer relationship intangibles, shared-loss agreements and the related indemnification assets, Purchase Money Note, and FHLB advances. For further discussion of the Firm’s accounting policies and valuation methodologies, refer to Note 2 and Note 3 for fair value measurement, Note 10 for investment securities, Note 12 for loans, Note 17 for deposits, and Note 28 for lending-related commitments. Core deposit and customer relationship intangibles Core deposit and certain wealth management customer relationship intangibles were acquired as part of the First Republic acquisition. The core deposit intangible of $1.3 billion was valued by discounting estimated after-tax cost savings over the remaining useful life of the deposits using the favorable source of funds method. The after-tax cost savings were estimated based on the difference between the cost of maintaining the core deposit base relative to the cost of next best alternative funding sources available to market participants. The customer relationship intangibles of $180 million were valued by discounting estimated after- tax earnings over their remaining useful lives using the multi-period excess earnings method. Both intangible asset valuations utilized assumptions that the Firm believes a market participant would use to estimate fair values, such as growth and attrition rates, projected fee income as well as related costs to service the relationships, and discount rates. The core deposit and customer relationship intangibles will be amortized over a projected period of future cash flows of approximately 7 years. Refer to Note 15 for further discussion on other intangible assets. Indemnification assets - Shared-loss agreements The indemnification assets represent forecasted recoveries from the FDIC associated with the shared-loss assets over the respective shared-loss recovery periods. The indemnification assets were recorded at fair value in other Notes to consolidated financial statements 308 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K assets on the Consolidated balance sheets on the acquisition date. The fair values of the indemnification assets were estimated based on the timing of the forecasted losses underlying the related allowance for credit losses. The subsequent quarterly remeasurement of the indemnification assets is based on changes in the amount and timing of forecasted losses in the allowance for credit losses associated with the shared-loss assets and is recorded in other income. Under certain circumstances, the Firm may be required to make a payment to the FDIC upon termination of the shared-loss agreements based on the level of actual losses and recoveries on the shared-loss assets. The estimated potential future payment is reflected as contingent consideration as part of the purchase price consideration. Purchase Money Note and FHLB advances The Purchase Money Note is recorded in long-term debt on the Consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of the Purchase Money Note was estimated based on a discounted cash flow methodology and incorporated estimated market discount rates. The FHLB advances assumed in the acquisition are recorded in short-term borrowings and in long-term debt. The fair values of the FHLB advances were based on a discounted cash flow methodology and considered the observed FHLB advance issuance rates. Loans The following table presents the unpaid principal balance (\"UPB\") and estimated fair values of the loans acquired as of May 1, 2023, and reflects adjustments to the acquisition-date fair value of the loans acquired through December 31, 2023.

Unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information Included in the Firm's Consolidated statements of income are noninterest revenue, net interest income and net income contributed by First Republic of $4.4 billion, $3.7 billion and $4.1 billion, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2023. The following table presents certain unaudited pro forma financial information for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 as if the First Republic acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2022, including recognition of the estimated bargain purchase gain of $2.8 billion and the provision for credit losses of $1.2 billion. Additional adjustments include the interest on the Purchase Money Note and the impact of amortizing and accreting certain estimated fair value adjustments related to intangible assets, loans and lending-related commitments. The Firm expects to achieve operating cost savings and other business synergies resulting from the acquisition that are not reflected in the pro forma amounts. The pro forma information is not necessarily indicative of the historical results of operations had the acquisition occurred on January 1, 2022, nor is it indicative of the results of operations in future periods, particularly in light of recent changes in market and economic conditions.

The attribution between volume and rate is calculated using annual average balances for each category of assets and liabilities shown in the table and the corresponding annual rates (refer to pages 310-313 for more information on average balances and rates). In this analysis, when the change cannot be isolated to either volume or rate, it has been allocated to volume. The annual rates include the impact of changes in market rates, as well as the impact of any change in composition of the various products within each category of asset or liability. This analysis is calculated separately for each category without consideration of the relationship between categories (for example, the net spread between the rates earned on assets and the rates paid on liabilities that fund those assets). As a result, changes in the granularity or groupings considered in this analysis would produce a different attribution result, and due to the complexities involved, precise allocation of changes in interest rates between volume and rates is inherently complex and judgmental. 2023 versus 2022 2022 versus 2021 (Unaudited) Increase/(decrease) due to change in: Increase/(decrease) due to change in: Year ended December 31, (On a taxable-equivalent basis; in millions) Volume Rate Net change Volume Rate Net change Interest-earning assets Deposits with banks: U.S. $ (8,225) $ 16,155 $ 7,930 $ (1,185) $ 7,910 $ 6,725 Non-U.S. (361) 5,189 4,828 166 1,636 1,802 Federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements: U.S. 1,347 4,792 6,139 267 1,625 1,892 Non-U.S. (629) 4,937 4,308 311 1,471 1,782 Securities borrowed: U.S. (411) 4,839 4,428 64 2,066 2,130 Non-U.S. (95) 1,413 1,318 69 423 492 Trading assets – debt instruments: U.S. 3,358 1,949 5,307 375 1,509 1,884 Non-U.S. 666 931 1,597 (418) 775 357 Investment securities: U.S. (1,690) 8,165 6,475 1,061 2,534 3,595 Non-U.S. 228 651 879 (2) 207 205 Loans: U.S. 10,296 17,635 27,931 2,988 6,750 9,738 Non-U.S. (258) 3,039 2,781 148 1,328 1,476 All other interest-earning assets, predominantly U.S. (3,749) 7,655 3,906 161 2,708 2,869 Change in interest income 477 77,350 77,827 4,005 30,942 34,947 Interest-bearing liabilities Interest-bearing deposits: U.S. (1,284) 20,511 19,227 268 5,857 6,125 Non-U.S. 597 10,110 10,707 161 3,265 3,426 Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements: U.S. 1,293 6,263 7,556 (466) 3,327 2,861 Non-U.S. (480) 2,462 1,982 93 493 586 Trading liabilities – debt, short-term and all other interest-bearing liabilities: U.S. 409 4,981 5,390 206 2,523 2,729 Non-U.S. (17) 1,924 1,907 125 756 881 Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs, predominantly U.S. 381 346 727 (69) 212 143 Long-term debt: U.S. 2,494 5,229 7,723 75 3,722 3,797 Non-U.S. (3) 8 5 (31) 27 (4) Change in interest expense 3,390 51,834 55,224 362 20,182 20,544 Change in net interest income $ (2,913) $ 25,516 $ 22,603 $ 3,643 $ 10,760 $ 14,403 Changes in net interest income, volume and rate analysis 314 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K 2023 versus 2022 2022 versus 20212023 versus 2022 2022 versus 2021 Increase/(decrease) due to change in: Increase/(decrease) due to change in: 2022 Form 10-K: Annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

Glossary of Terms and Acronyms JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K 315 Credit derivatives: Financial instruments whose value is derived from the credit risk associated with the debt of a third-party issuer (the reference entity) which allow one party (the protection purchaser) to transfer that risk to another party (the protection seller). Upon the occurrence of a credit event by the reference entity, which may include, among other events, the bankruptcy or failure to pay its obligations, or certain restructurings of the debt of the reference entity, neither party has recourse to the reference entity. The protection purchaser has recourse to the protection seller for the difference between the face value of the CDS contract and the fair value at the time of settling the credit derivative contract. The determination as to whether a credit event has occurred is generally made by the relevant International Swaps and Derivatives Association (“ISDA”) Determinations Committee.

Origination date LTV ratios are calculated based on the actual appraised values of collateral (i.e., loan-level data) at the origination date. Current estimated LTV ratio An estimate of the LTV as of a certain date. The current estimated LTV ratios are calculated using estimated collateral values derived from a nationally recognized home price index measured at the metropolitan statistical area (“MSA”) level. These MSA-level home price indices consist of actual data to the extent available and forecasted data where actual data is not available. As a result, the estimated collateral values used to calculate these ratios do not represent actual appraised loan-level collateral values; as such, the resulting LTV ratios are necessarily imprecise and should therefore be viewed as estimates. Combined LTV ratio The LTV ratio considering all available lien positions, as well as unused lines, related to the property. Combined LTV ratios are used for junior lien home equity products.

MBS: Mortgage-backed securities MD&A: Management’s discussion and analysis Measurement alternative: Measures equity securities without readily determinable fair values at cost less impairment (if any), plus or minus observable price changes from an identical or similar investment of the same issuer. Merchant Services: offers merchants payment processing capabilities, fraud and risk management, data and analytics, and other payments services. Through Merchant Services, merchants of all sizes can accept payments via credit and debit cards and payments in multiple currencies. MEV: Macroeconomic variable Moody’s: Moody’s Investor Services Mortgage origination channels: Retail – Borrowers who buy or refinance a home through direct contact with a mortgage banker employed by the Firm using a branch office, the Internet or by phone. Borrowers are frequently referred to a mortgage banker by a banker in a Chase branch, real estate brokers, home builders or other third parties. Correspondent – Banks, thrifts, other mortgage banks and other financial institutions that sell closed loans to the Firm. Mortgage product types: Alt-A Alt-A loans are generally higher in credit quality than subprime loans but have characteristics that would disqualify the borrower from a traditional prime loan. Alt-A lending characteristics may include one or more of the following: (i) limited documentation; (ii) a high CLTV ratio; (iii) loans secured by non-owner occupied properties; or (iv) a debt-to-income ratio above normal limits. A substantial proportion of the Firm’s Alt-A loans are those where a borrower does not provide complete documentation of his or her assets or the amount or source of his or her income. Option ARMs The option ARM real estate loan product is an adjustable- rate mortgage loan that provides the borrower with the option each month to make a fully amortizing, interest-only or minimum payment. The minimum payment on an option ARM loan is based on the interest rate charged during the introductory period. This introductory rate is usually significantly below the fully indexed rate. The fully indexed rate is calculated using an index rate plus a margin. Once the introductory period ends, the contractual interest rate charged on the loan increases to the fully indexed rate and adjusts monthly to reflect movements in the index. The minimum payment is typically insufficient to cover interest accrued in the prior month, and any unpaid interest is deferred and added to the principal balance of the loan. Option ARM loans are subject to payment recast, which converts the loan to a variable-rate fully amortizing loan upon meeting specified loan balance and anniversary date triggers. Prime Prime mortgage loans are made to borrowers with good credit records who meet specific underwriting requirements, including prescriptive requirements related to income and overall debt levels. New prime mortgage borrowers provide full documentation and generally have reliable payment histories. Subprime Subprime loans are loans that, prior to mid-2008, were offered to certain customers with one or more high risk characteristics, including but not limited to: (i) unreliable or poor payment histories; (ii) a high LTV ratio of greater than 80% (without borrower-paid mortgage insurance); (iii) a high debt-to-income ratio; (iv) an occupancy type for the loan is other than the borrower’s primary residence; or (v) a history of delinquencies or late payments on the loan.

Loans (other than credit card loans and certain consumer loans insured by U.S. government agencies) are placed on nonaccrual status when full payment of principal and interest is not expected, regardless of delinquency status, or when principal and interest have been in default for a period of 90 days or more unless the loan is both well-secured and in the process of collection. Collateral-dependent loans are typically maintained on nonaccrual status.

These unvested awards meet the definition of participating securities. Under the two-class method, all earnings (distributed and undistributed) are allocated to each class of common stock and participating securities, based on their respective rights to receive dividends. PCAOB: Public Company Accounting Oversight Board PCD: “Purchased credit deteriorated” assets represent acquired financial assets that as of the date of acquisition have experienced a more-than-insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination, as determined by the Firm. PD: Probability of default Pillar 1: The Basel framework consists of a three “Pillar” approach.

Pillar 3 encourages market discipline through disclosure requirements which allow market participants to assess the risk and capital profiles of banks. PPP: Paycheck Protection Program under the Small Business Association (“SBA”) PRA: Prudential Regulation Authority Pre-provision profit/(loss): Represents total net revenue less noninterest expense. The Firm believes that this financial measure is useful in assessing the ability of a lending institution to generate income in excess of its provision for credit losses. Pre-tax margin: Represents income before income tax expense divided by total net revenue, which is, in management’s view, a comprehensive measure of pretax performance derived by measuring earnings after all costs are taken into consideration.

Principal transactions revenue: Principal transactions revenue is driven by many factors, including: Glossary of Terms and Acronyms JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K 319 • the bid-offer spread, which is the difference between the price at which a market participant is willing and able to sell an instrument to the Firm and the price at which another market participant is willing and able to buy it from the Firm, and vice versa; and • realized and unrealized gains and losses on financial instruments and commodities transactions, including those accounted for under the fair value option, primarily used in client-driven market-making activities. – Realized gains and losses result from the sale of instruments, closing out or termination of transactions, or interim cash payments. – Unrealized gains and losses result from changes in valuation. In connection with its client-driven market-making activities, the Firm transacts in debt and equity instruments, derivatives and commodities, including physical commodities inventories and financial instruments that reference commodities. Principal transactions revenue also includes realized and unrealized gains and losses related to: • derivatives designated in qualifying hedge accounting relationships, primarily fair value hedges of commodity and foreign exchange risk; • derivatives used for specific risk management purposes, primarily to mitigate credit, foreign exchange and interest rate risks. Production revenue: Includes fees and income recognized as earned on mortgage loans originated with the intent to sell, and the impact of risk management activities associated with the mortgage pipeline and warehouse loans.

RHS: Rural Housing Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture ROA: Return on assets ROE: Return on equity ROTCE: Return on tangible common equity ROU assets: Right-of-use assets RSU(s): Restricted stock units RWA: “Risk-weighted assets”: Basel III establishes two comprehensive approaches for calculating RWA (a Standardized approach and an Advanced approach) which include capital requirements for credit risk, market risk, and in the case of Basel III Advanced, also operational risk. Key differences in the calculation of credit risk RWA between the Standardized and Advanced approaches are that for Basel III Advanced, credit risk RWA is based on risk-sensitive approaches which largely rely on the use of internal credit models and parameters, whereas for Basel III Standardized, credit risk RWA is generally based on supervisory risk- weightings which vary primarily by counterparty type and asset class. Market risk RWA is calculated on a generally consistent basis between Basel III Standardized and Basel III Advanced.

Taxable-equivalent basis: In presenting results on a managed basis, the total net revenue for each of the business segments and the Firm is presented on a tax- equivalent basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in managed basis results on a level comparable to taxable investments and securities; the corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense.
